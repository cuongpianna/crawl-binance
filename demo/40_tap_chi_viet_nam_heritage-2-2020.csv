**Vietjet opens three more direct routes linking Vietnam with India, further
boosting the regional connection**

**_*The new routes of Da Nang – New Delhi, Hanoi/HCMC – Mumbai to commence
operations in May*_**  

**(Ho Chi Minh City, February 6, 2020) –** To meet rising demand for travel
between Vietnam and India as well as across the region, Vietjet has opened
three new direct routes connecting Vietnam’s three largest hubs, Da Nang,
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with two of India’s largest economic, political
and cultural centers of New Delhi and Mumbai.

Accordingly, the Da Nang – New Delhi and Hanoi – Mumbai routes will commence
operations starting from May 14, 2020 with a frequency of five flights per
week and three flights per week respectively. The Ho Chi Minh City – Mumbai
routes will operate four weekly flights from May 15, 2020.  

“We are excited to continue connecting Vietnam destinations to the market of
over 1.2 billion population in India after receiving positive feedback
regarding our previous two direct flights that linked both Ho Chi Minh City
and Hanoi with New Delhi,” said **Vietjet Vice President Nguyen Thanh Son**.

“With just over five hours of flight time per leg, and a convenient flight
schedule throughout the week, Vietjet’s newest routes between Vietnam and
India will create many more trade and tourism opportunities between the two
countries, helping to boost the economies of both. The expansion of Vietjet’s
flight network into India also reaffirms the airline’s ongoing commitment to
continuously help flyers save on cost and time. Passengers can enjoy flying on
our new and modern aircraft and taking transit flights to famous destinations
across Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and
many other countries, thanks to Vietjet’s extensive flight network in the Asia
Pacific region”, he added.
