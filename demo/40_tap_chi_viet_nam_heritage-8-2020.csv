especially fond of learning. Rich historical periods, some peaceful, some
turbulent, have form unique characteristics in terms of cultural and
educational traditions, creating the identity and personality of the people
here. Da Nang education, quite comprehensively developed at all levels, has a
special rank compared to other places in the country. Public and private
schools are increasingly expanding in scope, pioneering in quality
accreditation, especially by internationally respected authorities. The people
of Mid-Vietnam in general and Da Nang in particular always strive for learning
and investing in younger generations’ education. It is a beautiful feature to
be appreciated, respected and further developed.

Taking advantage of those favorable conditions, St. Nicholas School of Da Nang
pioneers in establishing a continuous system from kindergarten to high school.
Furthermore, it integrates the Vietnamese school curriculum with some American
curriculum, and hence its graduates can have both Vietnamese and US high
school diplomas which certify their wealth of knowledge and skills.

As a proud partner school of Texas Tech University, one of America’s public
universities leading in research and application of education technologies,
St. Nicholas school has been pursuing and implementing the world’s most
advanced education model, providing students with solid, modern education
foundation and a firm pathway as they reach out to the world.

**A special feature of the education system of St. Nicholas school is the

Teachers are the ones to make knowledge digestible for the kids. St. Nicholas
school teachers constantly improve and enrich their professional capabilities.
They are also the role models for the kids to look up to. They are high
achievers, too. Mr. Dirk Myburgh, STEM teacher of the school has published a
paper on removal of COD from industrial biodiesel wastewater using an
integrated process in the Springer Link, a prestigious scientific journal.

Not only are its teaching methods and tools modern and optimal, this school is
also a symbol of humane edification as it puts kindness and love at the core
foundation of the knowledge it conveys to the subsequent generations.

The school wishes nothing more than that its students will inherit and always
keep in mind the humane philosophy of St. Nicholas. The teachers always want
them to **dream good dreams** – dreams associated with the journey of finding
one’s own self in the vast universe. The school will accompany its students in
those dreams and act as a launching pad for them to soar high into the future.

In that journey, students will learn and forge **Creativity, Resilience,
Integrity Empathy, and Gratitude** and appreciation for those around them.
These are the core human values that the school strives to build in students
with its personality education program. These help students of St. Nicholas
School to fully develop to reach their dreams in the future and become
positive, active members of their community – just like what St. Nicholas has
done throughout his life.

8/18/2020,Vietnamese-American NGO Mask Producer Donates Masks To Hospitals In Beirut,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/vietnamese-american-ngo-mask-producer-donates-masks-to-hospitals-in-beirut/,,,,,"“ **Vietnamese-American NGO Mask Producer Donates Masks To Hospitals In
Beirut”**

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam—19 August 2020

Vietnam helmet maker Protec (Vietnam Safety Products & Equipment Company) who
recently added Covid-19 mask production for humanitarian assistance, have
donated 10,000 medical masks and gloves to Abou Jaoude Hospital in Beirut,
after the recent deadly explosion of Ammonium Nitrate.

Hard hit hospitals in Beirut are suffering from medical supply shortages,
especially basics such as masks, protective gowns, hats, booties and gloves.

The explosion and after effects of Ammonium Nitrate is extremely dangerous
because of the chemical effects on lungs and respiratory systems, seriously
affecting infants and children. Latest figures report 6000 injured, many
critically, and more than 300,000 homeless, vulnerable to chemical after-
affects from living outdoors.

Ammonium Nitrate inhalation causes high concentrations of chemical dust that
can cause respiratory tract irritation. Symptoms include coughing, sore
throat, breathing difficulty, even suffocation. In high concentrations,
ammonium nitrate can cause headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting,
bloody diarrhea, weakness, psychological complications, heart and circulation
irregularities, convulsions, and collapse.

Ammonium Nitrate also forms an acid when mixed with water, which can cause
irritation to the eyes, nose, and skin. This will be an ongoing serious public
health crisis for the people and children of Beirut, which masks can help
mitigate.

Protec, and owner AIP Foundation, along with partner FIA Foundation from the
UK are appealing for support and contributions of masks and gloves at other
hospitals in Beirut. “We are grateful for assistance from the Government of
Vietnam, the Embassy of Lebanon and even private Vietnamese citizens for their
support”, says AIP Foundation President Greig Craft. “This is no time for
politics, religion nor race. Support and assistance is urgently needed”, Craft
added.
