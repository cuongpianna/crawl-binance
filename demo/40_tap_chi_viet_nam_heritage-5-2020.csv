HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam –– 5 May 2020

PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards, the region’s leading real estate awards
programme, is moving forward this year with a new timeline for its Vietnamese
edition.

The organisers have made the responsible decision to postpone the 6th
PropertyGuru Vietnam Property Awards’ black-tie gala dinner, previously set
for August, to ensure the safety and health of guests, venues, and staff
members.

The InterContinental Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City will now host Vietnam’s
leading annual real estate gala event, which is set to be held on Friday, 18
September. The general public are still encouraged to submit their nominations
online until 26 June via <https://www.asiapropertyawards.com/nominations>

The rescheduled key dates for the PropertyGuru Vietnam Property Awards are as
follows:

26 June 2020 – Nominations Close

3 July 2020 – Entries Close

13-31 July 2020 – Site Inspections

5 August 2020 – Final Judging

18 September 2020 – Gala Dinner and Awards Ceremony in HCMC, Vietnam

4 December 2020 – Grand Final Gala Ceremony in Bangkok, Thailand

Precautionary health protocols will be followed stringently leading up to and
on the day of the gala events.

Existing entries will also be judged as normal based on the established
criteria whilst entry submission cut-offs will be extended as necessary for
each market.

The new gala dates will then subsequently extend the logo rights of the
eventual Winners and Highly Commended awardees.

Jules Kay, Managing Director of the PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards, said:
“With the safety of our guests remaining a number one priority, we want to
ensure that we hold our events at a time when our award nominees and other
stakeholders feel comfortable and ready to fully celebrate their
achievements.”
