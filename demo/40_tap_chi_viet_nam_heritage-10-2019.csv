10/8/2019,Nature reserve offers hidden delights,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/nature-reserve-offers-hidden-delights/,,,,,"_(No.2, Vol.9,Apr-May 2019 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)  
_  
In early 2019, Na Hang – Lam Binh Nature Reserve in Tuyen Quang Province was
recognized as a “National Special Scenic Attraction.” Located in Na Hang and
Lam Binh districts, 250km from Hanoi, this 40,000ha attraction has 33,061ha of
forests and 8,000ha of lakes.  
Multiple lakes densely surrounding karsts help diversify wildlife in the Na
Hang – Lam Binh forests with 1,162 floral species and 430 fauna species,
including black snub-nosed monkeys, which can be found only in Vietnam.  
Scientists have also found in the caves within the Na Hang – Lam Binh forests
traces of prehistoric people. During the recent historical period, many of the
caves within the reserve were used as military camps, offices and weapon
production factories of the Vietnamese army in the wars against the French and
Americans.  
Today, about 15 ethnic minorities live in the forests of Na Hang – Lam Binh
with their unique culture, making it a diverse cultural environment.  
With the above mentioned natural, historical and cultural characteristics the
Na Hang – Lam Binh Nature Reserve has many secrets waiting for visitors to
uncover.  
According to the authorities of Tuyen Quang Province, the nature reserve has
52 spots for tourists to visit, including 32 scenic places, seven
archaeological relics, nine vestiges of architecture and arts, and four
cultural heritage sites. A dozen of these spots have been ranked national
attractions or relics.  
 **  
The most notable spots  
** 99 Thuong Lam peaks in Thuong Lam Commune of Lam Binh District is one of
the most beautiful places in the reserve, about 15km from the Lam Binh
District township. The 99 peaks are not only picturesque, but also related to
a mythological legend.  
Song Long Cave of Khuon Ha Commune of Lam Binh District is bigger and more
beautiful among the caves of the reserve. The 200m- long cave is about 50m
wide with the ceiling 40m high, full of mysterious-looking and magnificent
stalactites that look like chandeliers.  
Phia Muon Cave, an archaeological relic in Son Phu Commune is about 7km from
Na Hang township. This is the dwelling space and graveyard of prehistoric
people. In this cave, scientists found sophisticated stone tools and graves
dated 3500 – 4500 years ago. Visitors to Phia Muon cave will see dozens of
such graves of the post-Neolithic times and the dwelling of people of that
ancient era.  
Age-old villages of the Tay people such as those of Dong Da, Ban Khe, Bang
Giong, Na Ta etc. are purely Tay villages where Tay people maintain their
ancient lifestyle, customs and culture. Each village is a group of ancient
stilted houses standing at a foothill near terraced paddy fields, creating a
peaceful and poetic scenery. People live by growing rice, domestic animals,
and weaving traditional brocades. To many, the image of Tay women in
traditional garments sitting by an old loom is a symbol of this land.

A photo of Hue by Nhat Long

_**In the first days of the New Year 2019, Thuy Lien had a conversation with
photographer Luong Nam Nhat Long from Hue, First Prize winner in the category
of Young Authors in the 2018 Vietnam Heritage Photo Awards for the photo “ Out
of Class”  
**_

**Hi Long, please talk about why you took part in the 2018 Vietnam Heritage
photo contest?**  
I was wandering randomly on Facebook and stumbled on this photo contest ad of
Vietnam Heritage, and the exciting ao dai theme made me register.  
I browsed through the pics of ao dai I took that had some element of heritage,
and stopped at the one of young female students on Trang Tien Bridge. In this
picture, a film crew was re-enacting a scene of students of Dong Khanh School
of the old times for a music video background.  
 **How did you feel about winning the first prize in the category of Young
Authors in the 2018 Contest of Vietnam Heritage Photography?  
** I was happily overwhelmed. I knew I won a prize, but not which one. When I
came into that room and heard my name, I was dumbstruck. People had to call me
again to come up the stage. I was overjoyed.  
In Hue, there are so many great masters of photographing ao dai, while I am
not even a professional at that. All children of Hue love their native land as
much as I do, I guess. But I both do and don’t want Hue to develop, because
its quintessence is in peaceful and slow pace of life, not boisterous like
other cities.  
 **What is photography in your life?  
** I took photos all the time to record moments of my life, but with my
smartphone only because that was all I had. I liked my pictures and sent them
to the contests of photos taken with a smartphone. I got a prize, which was a
real photo camera.  
Actually, my major is IT, which has very little to do with photography.
Programming is mechanical in nature. It is not artistic at all. I currently
work as a photographer for a few newspapers in Thua Thien – Hue and freelance
in web programming.  
 **How does your family react to your working as a photographer?  
** In fact, at first they didn’t like the idea that I followed the photography
craft and even tried to stop me. They wanted me to work in the field I
studied. Another reason was that nobody in my family practiced photography.  
So I quit for about a year. Then I felt the itch to go out and take pictures.
Later, as I achieved a few small successes, my family stopped opposing me and
even started supporting me.  
 **Can the 2018 Vietnam Heritage Photo Awards be seen then as a pivoting point
in your career?  
** The prize won may very well be an important milestone in my career as a
photographer. After the contest, many more people have come to know me,
certainly.  
In the prize-awarding ceremony the authors had a chance to mingle and meet,
and that was a great way to network. I personally had a chance to meet many
people I have been long admiring but never got to see.  
 **Share with us some little stories you find interesting about your practice?  
** In my practice, there are plenty of such stories, but the ones about
photographing the Milky Way are the most memorable. I have never succeeded to
take a decent picture, not yet.  
Theoretically, one can see the Milky Way from everywhere, but actually it is
impossible to photograph it in the city. One has to go away, far from human
settlements in order to capture it.  
In Hue, the Milky Way usually can be seen at about 2 – 3 am. To have a good
picture, one needs a unique and unexpected angle. Once a friend of mine and I
went to a cemetery to sit and wait. It was so eerie; we both sweated profusely
although it was quite cold.  
Another time, quite recently, I went with three friends to Bach Ma national
park to take pictures of red maples, but we took very little food because we
thought it wouldn’t take too long. We had only six packages of biscuits, all
in a bag carried by the chubbiest guy..The scenery turned out to be too
beautiful along the way, so we stopped a lot to take pictures, and the day
passed by unnoticed. The biscuit carrier had chewed all the biscuits
involuntarily because he was very quick at getting hungry. We had but a little
water left, and a lot of laughter.  
We have seen the famous red-shanked douc at Son Tra, but they were too far
away so I could only enjoy watching them without taking any picture.  
 **You obviously have a special love for Hue, which is also a familiar
destination for tourism in Vietnam. Is there anything special about Hue that
you would like to share?  
** I have plenty. Take for example the ao dai of Hue, or the Hue rains. But a
photo set taken in just 1-2 years can never be enough.  
You can go around to see how Vinh Thanh fishermen catch squids, and to see
their hardship during the high water season. Recently, photographers took very
beautiful pictures of the Ru Cha mangrove, mostly using flycams.  
Hue is also famous with the craft villages such as bronze cast village,
delicacies village, and mussel village that make many dishes with tiny
mussels.  
Talking about Hue. one must mention the great ceremonies such as the staged
Heaven and Earth Consecration, Nation Consecration, and the New Year tree
erection inside the citadel at 3am.  
The Heaven and Earth Consecration is a men-only ritual. Attendees must wear
traditional outfits. The high ranking mandarins host the event and conduct the
ritual. They are accompanied by a drum team, a blowpipe team and a dance team.
The offerings normally include fruits and five different animals.  
The ritual includes presenting to the deities wines, reports and a seal. The
ritual is always solemn and full of grandeur because Hue people have high
spiritual values. The people attending it always take home some godsend. They
say it has power so I also take it (laughter).  
 **What 2019 will be for you, a year completely devoted to photography and
Hue?  
** Yes, sure. I will learn to improve my technical skills, and earn more to
acquire some dream equipment. In addition, I hope to collaborate with many
more entities to bring the image of Hue to more people.  
 **I wish that your plans are realized in 2019. Thank you for a sincere and
enthusiastic conversation.**

Today’s Phu Tho Province was the land chosen by Hung Kings, the first rulers
of Vietnam, to be their capital. Considered the cradle of the Viet people,
this area still preserves the temples of Hung Kings and many other historical
relics such as pagodas and shrines.

A midland area lying between mountains and lowland planes, the Phu Tho
landscape is imposing, commanding, and poetic at the same time. The lush
rolling tea hills are a perfect example of that.

Phu Tho is currently one of the provinces with the largest tea plantation
areas in the country. The tea trees not only benefit thousands of households
but also create enchanting beauty for the land of Phu Tho.

The tea hill of Long Coc, Tan Son District is one of the most typical, most
beautiful tea hills of Phu Tho. From this vantage point, one can see a
countless number of green tea hills teeming all around, each looking like a
coiled dragon.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/134B-Bo%202-PC17-06p.jpg)

Mother Nature has blessed this land with the soil and weather best suitable
for growing tea, and tea has been growing here for ages. The all-green beauty
of these winding hills inevitably fascinates all who have ever been to these
600ha tea plantations. Rows of tea plants soften the form of the hills. The
typical dark green color of tea leaves, shining and lush, which remains the
same all year round, makes it feel so calm, so peaceful, yet so endearing.

It is best to view the Long Coc tea hill early in the morning, when one can
feel the harmony between nature and humans, when timid rays of the sun try to
penetrate silky layers of the morning mist. That’s when ladies and young girls
start to come up these hills and their hands begin the magic dance among the
tea buds still heavy with dewdrops.

The scenic charm of the tea hills, the happy hard-working life, full of
positive optimism and the tea culture of the people of Phu Tho makes it an
interesting and attractive destination for many genres of tourism.

In April, the last fiery flowers of the cotton trees spark on mountain slopes.
With the long-brewing desire inside to conquer the scenic tourist path from
Bac Ha (Lao Cai) to Xin Man, the most desolate highland district of Ha Giang
Province, we hit the road on a beautiful weekend.

From Bac Ha township, the winding road up the Lung Phinh slope to the Lung Cai
– Ban Gia fork is very smooth, lined with newly planted corn fields that began
rooting and springing tender buds and terrace fields waiting for the first
rain showers to begin new crops. Some milpas previously used to grow soya are
now growing pharmaceuticals in order to make more income for local farmers.
Looking from above down at the rows of ashweed and artichoke covered with
nylon sheets, one realizes how well the highland farmers are catching up with
new technologies.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/-Gy%20la%20cung%20=%C2%B2_ng%20=%C2%B2_c%20r_t%20nhi_u%20cua-r\)%20ch_n%20lam%20=%C2%B2_ng%20=ua%20l_%20t%C2%B2_ngp.jpg)

Having passed Lung Cai, we come to the frontier area, which begins with Nan Ma
Commune, where it is rumored among trampers the valley is fantastic during the
season of ripening rice. Although coming not at the time this natural scene is
exhibited, we had nevertheless a very specific feeling one always has when
coming for the first time to a new land. We passed the center of the commune
with a school, an administrative center and houses on the roadsides, just like
the other Bac Ha and Si Ma Cai highland communes of Lao Cai. Nan Ma folks told
us that this national tourist destination witnessed the heroic death of 11
military entertainers during the war of resistance. The place also boasts the
Cave of Fairies where one can pray for good health.

It was summer but the weather felt like that of autumn, making the journey so
much more pleasurable amidst the imposing, majestic highlands. We were
especially impressed by the rocky mountains and the paddy fields full of big
and small rocks scattered all around. Here and there, rocks stack up like
massive quires of stone papers. Sometimes we encounter Xin Man villagers
working the rocky land before sowing the seeds, an image we have previously
seen only on TV. Forest flowers bloom timidly on the slopes. A rare coral tree
covered in brightly red flowers stood out like a landmark in the serenity of
the mountains.

From the top of the slope in Nan Ma, we looked down at the multiple coils of
the road deep in the gorge, knowing that’s the path we would take to get to
Coc Pai. The view before us was breathtaking. We went under lush pine groves
that whistled in the wind. The town of Coc Pai sunk deep at the bottom of the
gorge at the end of the coils of the road. Someone in our group was so moved
by the scenery as to utter a few verses lauding the beauty of the fatherland.
At Coc Pai, the center of the Xin Man District, we asked about the way to
proceed. From hearsay, from the 0km post of Coc Pai township, one has to go
25km to get to the Xin Man frontier bazaar or to the Fairy waterfall, and
145km to reach the chief town of the Ha Giang Province. But some folks in Coc
Pai say that it will be possible to get up to the Fairy waterfall only in May-
June.

Perhaps because there are now outstanding professional services like in other
famous tourist destinations, here at Xin Man, instead of fuss and crowds, we
felt very quiet, very private, very relaxed, completely freed from the mundane
haste. Many foreign tourists like to come here just to walk around in the
village and share the everyday life with the local ethnic minorities of H’Mon,
Cao Lan, Nung, Yao, La Chi, Phu La, Tay etc. on these rocky mountains. That’s
why the stretch of road between Bac Ha – Xin Man is so suitable for the
tourists who want to explore and experience the eternal calm, the poetic and
majestic scenery, the simple life and unique culture of the local highlanders.

On the tourist map of Ha Giang Province, Xin Man is marked as an attractive
destination with locations planned by the district government to be developed
into typical tourist packages to attract visitors to this rocky plateau. From
the words of a Coc Pai town resident as we took a rest, tourists coming to Xin
Man can visit Fairy Waterfall, Windy Pass, the ancient rock field in Nam Zan
Gorge at the headwaters of Chay River, and hot spring at Nam Choong (Quang
Nguyen Commune.) They can also enjoy foods and drinks of the local ethnic
minorities and learn about the unique features of their culture, as well as
legends about places that have secrets yet to be deciphered.

Winding roads, rocky mountains, rumbling waterfalls, scenic terrace fields,
and friendly, hospitable people were enough to give us a day as happy as could
be while we experienced the beautiful tour in the Northwest full of
interesting novelties. We vow to come back in the season of ripening rice and
buckwheat blossom.

10/8/2019,Traditional wedding of the White Yao people,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/traditional-wedding-of-the-white-yao-people/,,,,,"Having a son coming of age, a White Yao family begins selecting a wife for him
among the White Yao young girls in the same hamlet or one nearby. A sweetheart
chosen, they send a word to her family. If that night is quiet, without owls
crying or unusual cocks cooing, it’s a favorable omen meaning the future will
be smooth, and the girl’s family would agree.On a good day, the groom’s party
brings lavish offerings, including two castrated cocks, a 30kg pig, 10 liters
of rice wine and a certain amount of money etc. to the bride’s to have a feast
together and to fix a favorable date.On the fixed date, they conduct a wedding
with many traditional ceremonies. The wedding normally lasts three days and
two nights. _This photo set was taken at a White Yao wedding at Lang Son. Some
of the rituals have been modified to suit modern life._ It begins when the
bridegroom’s family sends 11 people in traditional outfits to receive the
bride. The delegation includes a master of ceremony, the bridegroom, and young
men versed in repartee singing.They bring offerings, including a silver
bracelet, betel and areca, salt, tea, rice buns, two large bundles of cassava
vermicelli, rice wine, eight origami fishes representing the multitude of
descendants the young couple will have, and a pipe containing ash and 24
leaves which guarantees good fortune and happiness and bars evil spiritsAs the
group enters the courtyard, the bride, veiled with a big and thick brocade
comes out to meet them. The party is “blocked” by the bride’s girl-friends,
singing folk songs that mean to dare them to come. The male party has to reply
in songs. Then the two parties make movements pretending to throw water on one
another. This means the bridegroom has to overcome obstacles in order to get
to the bride.After that, the male party is allowed into the house. The groom
alone has to cover his head with a coat and perform the feet cleansing ritual
under a shaman’s guidance, after which he enters an empty room because the
bride is already hidden away as the customs require.Meanwhile, the
representatives of the two parties and the go-betweens perform rituals at the
ancestral altar. Then the parties sing the suitable repartee songs in front of
the guests and villagers.At a good hour, usually 10 o’clock in the evening,
the two parties perform the wedding ceremony in which the major rite is
chasing away evil spirit with torches so it will not disturb the happiness of
the newlyweds.The next morning, the bridegroom prays to the ancestors at the
altar and offers wine to the grandparents and parents and the attending
guests. Then he goes home alone.When the groom is gone, the bride in
traditional wedding dress comes out to be greeted by the two parties, her face
hidden behind a hand fan. The Yao believe that leaving a bride’s face open may
lead to bad luck in her future family life.A man of the bridegroom’s party
puts the coat the groom used the previous day on the bride’s head. Then the
bridegroom’s party sings the “asking-for-her-hand” song. After that, the
shaman, bridesmaids, groomsmen and kinsfolks follow the bride to her new home.
The procession includes an orchestra of drums, blowpipes and cymbals that
plays emotional and funny songs along the way. The colorful wedding dress of
the bride stands out among the predominantly green scenery.According to the
customs, this procession must arrive at the groom’s at about 5 to 6 in the
afternoon. On the courtyard, a yellow coat is put on the bride’s head amidst
greetings from the groom’s clan. The groom comes out, and together with the
bride he performs rites at the ancestral altar. The shaman reads incantations,
and the ancestors grant the young couple their blessings and words of wisdom.
The young couple respectfully lift a glass of wine, take a sip, and kowtow to
the elders in the clan.The newlyweds are congratulated and blessed by the
clan, villagers and guests, some of whom may come from faraway. The air is
full of happiness and good will. Following the rituals is a lavish feast, full
of laughter, songs and dances. _The Yao minority has about 800,000 people
mostly living in the Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang and Lang Son provinces of the
Northern highlands. The Yao ethnicity consists of many groups such as Red Yao,
Yao Tien, Yao Cooc Mun, Tight Pants Yao, Yao O Giang, Yao Cooc Ngang, White
Yao, Yao Thanh Y, Yao Ao Zai etc. Yao culture is old and very rich, especially
that of the White Yao._ __

People who admire the heroism of the British divers that risked their lives to
rescue the young Thai boys from Tham Luang Cave will get the chance to follow
another mission by the same heroes in Vietnam.  
The famed divers Richard Stanton, John Volanthen, Jason Mallison and Chris
Jewell are diving inside Son Doong Cave in Quang Binh Province to explore a
mysterious passage found at the end of the cave.  
In June last year, twelve young boys, members of the youth football team Wild
Boars, together with their coach, entered Tham Luang cave network in Chiang
Rai, Thailand and were trapped by rising flood water.  
Richard Stanton and John Volanthen were the first divers who found the boys
alive in July, a miraculous rescue mission in an extremely dangerous
situation.  
In Vietnam, the four dived to explore a passage connecting this cave with
another cave nearby.  
The four worked with caving expert, Martin Holroyd, who works as a safety
guide in tour expeditions run by Oxalis Adventure Tours, the sole tour
provider into Son Doong. Cavers from the British Cave Research Association
suspected that Thung Cave, a grotto 600m from the end of Son Doong, connects
Son Doong through the passage. Thung Cave, explored in 1994, is 3.3km long and
it has a large river running inside, just like Son Doong.  
In 2010, during the thorough survey conducted by members of the British
association, the cavers found out that water from the river running inside Son
Doong goes through a gate at the end of the giant cave.  
At that time, the British caving team believed Son Doong and Thung caves
connected through the passage, as the river inside Son Doong was found coming
in a straight line from the end of Thung.  
According to Howard Limbert, who was a member of the 2010 team and is caving
technical director of Oxalis, it took the team members eight years to identify
where the current inside the passage led and they finally decided diving into
the passage would be the only way to have the answer.  
Limbert estimated the diving mission would be tough, as a large water volume
from the Son Doong River pouring into the passage would make the current
extremely strong.  
Oxalis worked with the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park to organise the mission
and the company sponsored US$53,000 for all the mission expenses. Oxalis
described the diving mission’s members as the best divers in the world but
Limbert cautioned that the job would be extremely risky.  
The mission commenced on April 1, when the experts believed that the Son Doong
River was in ideal conditions for diving. Water level inside the passage in
April was 40m deep. Oxalis’ boss Nguyen Chau A said he expected the passage
would prove to be the connector between Son Doong and Thung caves. If the two
caves were one, Son Doong’s overall volume would be over 40.4 million cubic
metres. The ‘expanded’ Son Doong would be bigger in volume compared to the
Clearwater Cave.  
Clearwater Cave is part of the Grunung Mulu National Park, which is located in
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Clearwater is 39.5 million cubic metres in volume.
Son Doong is 9km or 5.6 miles long, and with the 67.2m passage, the cave’s
overall volume is 38.8 million cubic metres. Thung Cave is 3.3km or 2 miles
and with a 22m estimated passage, it has overall volume of 1.6 million cubic
metres. Prior to the April mission, the duration of the task had not been
known Oxalis also organised a task force, including porters and supporters
familiar with caving inside Son Doong as well as trekking in the forest. The
team members were trained by experts from the British association and have
worked in the job for over a decade.  
They carry oxygen tanks, compressors, and camping equipment as well as
supporting the mission team members until reaching the passage’s entrance.  
Oxalis had strict guidelines to ensure the ecosystem inside the cave would be
well-protected, but they welcomed partners eligible for documenting and
reporting the incredible mission.  
Oxalis also expected the mission’s outcomes would contribute positively to
science and the study of karst caves. According to the company, the national
flag carrier Vietnam Airlines offered the four British divers free flights to
Quang Binh Province, where Son Doong is located.  
Members of British Cave Research Association have spent almost 30 years
exploring caves in the province. They discovered more than 300 dry caves and
caves with subterranean rivers. This was the first time the British cavers and
divers exploring an underground watery passage.  
Over three decades, the British cavers surveyed and announced systems of karst
caves in Quang Binh. The Phong Nha system includes Son Doong, Thung, Phong
Nha, Va, and Nuoc Nut caves. The Vom system comprises the caves of Vom and
Thien Duong (Paradise). The Nuoc Mooc has caves with water pouring into Mooc
stream. The Tu Lan system has Tu Lan, a group of caves and Tien Cave.  
Remarkably, the British cavers paid all related expense for the 30-year survey
by themselves. Howard Limbert and his partners consider Quang Binh, Vietnam
their second home and they have contributed much for Oxalis to exploit Son
Doong, Tu Lan and other caves for tourism in a sustainable and eco-friendly
way.

Oktoberfest Vietnam 2019 – the annual German beer festival – returns for its
15th year at Windsor Plaza Hotel. Oktoberfest Vietnam is a celebration of
authentic German food, beer, and fun, but also encompasses the flavors of its
Southeast Asian home. Festivities kick off each night at 6pm and run until

This annual event recreates the atmosphere found in the massive beer halls of
the original Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, complete with an expansive buffet

significant Oktoberfest celebration. “Each year this event grows larger and
larger, and this year we truly have something for everyone,” he said.

tents to banquet halls, the band is famous for their beer-toasting medleys.
