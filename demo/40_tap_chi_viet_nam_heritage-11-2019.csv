11/20/2019,Chirps of innocent birds,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/chirps-of-innocent-birds/,,by Cookie Vu,,,"**Vietnam Heritage, September-October 2011 Advertorial–** A sound sleep in the
eternal lullaby of the ocean in a modernly equipped thatched bungalow. A
leisurely walk _along crystal rivulets, where fish of all species leisurely
nibble at the pistia. A tasteful breakfast in the beachfront restaurant, from
where now and then one gets to see a muzzy iguana hesitantly crawling out of
the morning-glories. An idle sunbath on the beach while admiring sparrows flit
catching silhouettes in the coconut leaves. A dream come true? Well, maybe it
is more than a dream come true at four-star Bamboo Village Beach Resort, in
Mui Ne, Binh Thuan, about 200 kilometres to the northeast of Ho Chi Minh City.  
First, it is bamboos, as the name indicates. Clumps of bamboos dot along the
sinuous walks. Chunks of bamboos make the beds in the seafront bungalows.
Bamboo slats decorate the ceiling of the reception hall. There is bamboo in
the laundry baskets, the lamp shades, in the overall feeling of delicate
tranquillity one never misses at the resort.  
In that realm of bamboos, elegance is the touchstone, on which comfort,
sophistication, luxury and convenience are based, making Bamboo Village what
it is.  
Water Lily Spa clearly illustrates this idea. Natural-ingredient therapy
massage, spotless white futons, a wondrous view of the square pond, in which
pink water lily petals are opening to catch the melting golden sunbeams,
bananas and rose-mallows posture over the placid water surface, all are
arranged in a way that looks both natural and neat.  
Nature is also, distinctively at Bamboo Village, about grace. The bright
golden trumpets pace up and down over the lush green coiffed lawn. The dark
green ornamental creepers crawl on the light brown earth walls. Or the tiny
pinkish blossoming hearts of coral vines lighten up the darkish thatch roofâ€¦
All combine to create the peaceful, yet joyous, harmony of shapes, and
colours, fragrances, and species.  
Exemplifying sustainable development since its birth in 1998, Bamboo Village
Beach Resort manages to preserve 400 coconut trees, which are dozens of years
old.  
Also, â€˜Ours is the only resort in Vietnam to keep the sandy embankment,â€™
said Pham Phuong Dung, deputy manager of Bamboo Village Beach resort. Ms Pham,
whose life and career has been with the resort since its early days, talked
about unrewarding efforts until sand-bag embankment became tried and true.  
In contrast with the concrete walls at neighbouring resorts, the sand bags
have proved many advantages, both environmentally and economically.  
In addition to, and more important than, preserving the natural look of the
beach, sand bags, though cheap to prepare, absorb water, prevent the waves
from pounding the shore, eroding the sand and creating dangerous holes. When
the tide recedes the area in front of Bamboo Village stands out as flat beach
in the strip along the â€˜resort capitalâ€™ of Mui Ne. â€˜In the flood season,
eroded places are drowned and we often have vacationers from the neighbouring
resorts come share the plage,â€™ Ms Pham told Vietnam Heritage, with pride in
her voice.  
Her subordinate, Mr Tran Nhi Binh, added that every month they have a Green
Day, when all the staff, in green uniform, join hands to clean up the
environment in and around the resort. â€˜Guests give us a hand too. And itâ€™s
real fun,â€™ he said.  
Environment-friendliness is conducted in every little activity, in the signs
calling for saving water, encouraging re-using the towels, in the compact
fluorescent lights, etc.,  
Playing a part in the luxuriance of the vegetation at Bamboo Village is the
wastewater treatment system, which produces environmentally-safe water for the
flora. â€˜The only water we directly issue into the sea is rainwater,â€™ said
Pham Phuong Dung, the deputy manager.  
When it comes to accommodation, Bamboo Village Beach Resort offers a full
range of options: the Dove Cottage with the true sense of quiet, peaceful
isolation, or comfortable, homelike superior rooms, or stylized, high-class
Deluxe, or the modern, relaxing Nova Deluxe, or a stylish Queen room and
Prince rooms, or a graceful, romantic bungalow.  
Built specially to pay tribute to traditional Vietnamese cottages, while
highlighting the unique beauty of the bamboo, the thatched-roof, rammed-earth
wall bungalows are the soul of this recreation spot. They are what makes the
â€˜villageâ€™ factor in the name of the resort and where Bamboo Village
started back in the late 1990s. Each features breathtaking oceanic views,
hand-designed and creative landscape.  
Wherever you are at the resort, the things you can never miss are: the pure
fresh air, the joyous dances of the eternal waves, the refreshing chirps of
innocent, happy wild birds, the flourishing greenness of the carefully-
selected flora, the utmost comfort of the modern facilities, your satisfaction
and the desire to come back.  
â€˜This place gives us an opportunity to feel the nature and the soul of
Vietnam country,â€™ wrote The President of the Moscow Region (RS IPA –
International Police Association) on the website of the Bamboo Village Beach
Resort after his stay at Bamboo Village Beach Resort in July this year.

_  
Can Gio District is about 60 kilometres south east of downtown Ho Chi Minh
City. It is the cityâ€™s only seaside district and is also considered the
cityâ€™s lung.  
Its mangrove forest used to take up two-thirds of the districtâ€™s area of 714
square kilometers. That was 50 years ago, according to a tourist guidebook
issued by the Peopleâ€™s Committee of the district.  
Almost the whole forest was destroyed during the war. As peace returned in
1975, the cityâ€™s authorities launched several tree-planting campaigns. Now
the fauna and flora of Can Gio have recovered and are nearly the same as they
were, the book says. Can Gio was recognized by UNESCO as one of the worldâ€™s
biosphere reserves in 2000.  
Archaeologists have found broken pieces of ceramic and metal objects believed
to date to 2,500-3,000 years ago.  
At the moment, there are dozens of tourist attractions in Can Gio. From the
cityâ€™s centre, tourists can go by car, boat or motorcycle.  
I and my girlfriend rode a motorcycle to visit Can Gio. From District 1, we
crossed Khanh Hoi Bridge and ran on to Nguyen Tat Thanh Street in District 4.
At the end of Nguyen Tat Thanh St, we crossed Tan Thuan Bridge to go to
District 7 and ran on to Huynh Tan Phat St and went for about 10 kilometres
before arriving at Binh Khanh Ferry.  
We paid VND5,500 ($0.26) for a ticket for two people and a motorcycle and got
on a ferry full of people and motorcycles.  
After 15 minutes, we were on the other bank of the river and there were a lot
of mangrove trees on both sides of the road leading to Can Gio. The four-lane
road was quiet and the air was much fresher than downtown.  
Suddenly, the front tyre of my motorcycle went flat. We couldnâ€™t find a
place to get it fixed, so we pushed it back toward Binh Khanh Ferry. We found
a repair service after going for about 2 kilometres.  
Back on track, we passed about 10 bridges over canals weaving around large
forests. My girlfriend said, â€˜This road itself is an interesting tourist
attraction.â€™

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/2-Du-khach-di-xuong--quanh-.jpg)

At Ly Nhon T-junction, 30 kilometres from the ferry station, we saw a sign
which read â€˜Monkey Island Tourist Areaâ€™.  
Going as the arrow pointed, we turned right and rode for 1 km on a two-lane
asphalted road to the ticket counter. The tickets were VND35,000 ($1.67) each
on Saturdays and Sundays and VND30,000 ($1.43) each on weekdays. â€˜The
tickets are more expensive at weekends because there are animal circus
performances at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekends,â€™ the ticket seller explained.  
Leaving the ticket counter, we rode for another 100 metres to the centre of
the Monkey Island Tourist Area. There was a coffee shop, a restaurant and a
museum. The names of the objects in the museums are written in Vietnamese and
English.  
At the section where the old items were displayed, we saw different items like
pots, earrings, axes made of ceramic, stone and metal. They are from a few
hundred to 3,000 years old. There was a human skull 2,300 years old.  
Objects from the wars include personal belongings like soldier clothes, hats,
radios, watches and weapons.  
The section displaying biological objects showed land animals, amphibians and
aquatic animals. There were photos of leaves of the typical plants in the
mangrove forests of Can Gio. When going around the museum, we saw countless
empty drinking bottles.  
We went to the circus stage about 100 metres from the museum. Hundreds of
people were waiting around the circular stage under a roof.  
The animal-trainer started by letting three dogs jump through a ring, ride on
a seesaw and roll tubes; then, he made two monkeys do activities that
Vietnamese farmers used to do, like grinding and pounding rice, and carrying
water and firewood, all while walking on a small iron stick placed across two
barrels.  
Next was a performance by a crocodile with its mouth wide open, wagging its
tail and jumping up like it was trying to catch prey. The trainer ended the
show by putting his hand into the mouth of the cold-blooded animal.  
Near the circus stage was a place where tourists could hire a six-seat
speedboat for VND450,000 ($21.43) to go and visit a place which used to be a
force base of Vietnamese communists during the Vietnam war in the mangrove
forest. However, the tide was low and there was little water in the canals. We
did not take the trip and walked around instead.  
Hundreds of monkeys kept following tourists expecting food. At times, somebody
was startled when a monkey snatched food or drink from his or her hand. The
monkey climbed a tree ate the meal. â€˜Some people have had their food, drinks
and even cameras snatched by the monkeys,â€™ a security guard said.  
Food for monkeys can be bought here for VND3,000 ($0.14)/ bag. When a tourist
buys a bag of food, several monkeys rush up and wait. Some even put their
front legs around a leg of the tourist or jump and sit on his or her lap to
wait for a pea or a piece of potato.  
We visited an area of about 5,000 square metres with a wall around in which
they crocodiles are raised. Tourists can pay VND20,000 ($0.95) for a fishing
game. Three tourists got baits and dropped them where there were hundreds of
crocodiles waiting. There were dozens of open mouths on the water surface.
Sometimes a crocodile even rose out of water to catch the bait. Its jaws then
closed fast to produce a sound that made the tourists all laugh with
excitement.  
After walking round the Monkey Island Tourist Area of 2,140ha, we saw that it
was a forest area rather than an island like its name. We raised a question
about it and the tourist guide said, â€˜In fact, this is a monkey conservation
area, but people call it Monkey Island.â€™

11/20/2019,"Elephants v. defanged, declawed tigers",http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/elephants-v-defanged-declawed-tigers/,,By Nguyen Dac Xuan*,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1203161800---3.A.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DuavoivaoHoQuyen.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1203161801---Danvoidauvoiho.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/120316559--VN-Dia-danh-Hue-.jpg,"_(No.4, Vol.2 Apr 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

Há»• Quyá»n (há»•, here, means tiger and quyá»n boxing) arena, four
kilometres southwest of Hue, was for elephant and tiger fights to entertain
Emperor and staff. According to letters carved on the gate, the arena was
built in the 1830s, during the reign of Minh Mang.  
The arena was also used for the training of military elephants.  
Trader Pierre Poivre said, â€˜In 1750, the Lord of the Nguyen, Phuc Khoat, and
his servants went to Da Vien Island, near the arena, on 12 boats to witness
the fights between the tigers and elephants.â€™ In that combat, 40 elephants
killed 18 tigers.  
During the reign of Gia Long (1802-1919), all elephant-and-tiger fights were
on an empty piece of land in front of the Citadel. As there was no surrounding
wall, the King commanded his soldiers to stand in a circle.  
In a memoir, Souvenirs de Hue [Hue Memories] (published by Typhon in Shanghai,
China, 1941) Michel Duc Chaingeau, a Frenchman who had witnessed the fights
wrote, â€˜In a fight one day, although the tiger was tied alone to a reliable
pole and its nails and fangs chopped off, it managed to rip the rope off and
quickly jumped on to the elephant-driver. The driver was extremely frightened
and in no time was thrown to the ground and sadly crushed by his own elephant.
Then, with all his anger, the tiger jumped among the soldiers and a lot of
them were heavily injured. King Gia Long and his staff were completely
terrified.â€™  
Buu Ke wrote in Nguyá»…n Triá»u Cá»‘ Sá»± [Nguyen Dynasty Stories]: â€˜In
1829, the Nguyen Government held a combat between tigers and elephants on the
north bank of Huong River. His Majesty sat on a dragon boat anchored not far
off to watch. The tiger was tied on to a rope and the other end of the rope
was tied to a strong pole. However, during his match with an elephant, the
tiger pulled off the rope and jumped into the water, swimming towards the
Emperorâ€™s boat. . . . Emperor Minh Mang quickly took a stick (used to push
the boat) to scare the tiger off. Then he commanded his soldiers to use a
small boat to approach and kill the tiger in the water.  
Há»• Quyá»n, now in Nguyet Kieu Village, Thuy Bieu Ward, Hue City, was built
in the Year of the Tiger 1930 during the rule of Minh Mang. The fights were
held according to no schedule. Some years there were several, some years none.  
  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1203161800---3.A.jpg)  
From the book Hue Cite Imperiale du Vietnam, Edition Abbeville, 1995.

According to Phan Thuan An, author of â€˜Quáº§n Thá»ƒ Di TÃ­ch Huáº¿, 2007,â€™
[Hue Relics, 2007] the last match at Há»• Quyá»n occurred in 1904 during the
reign of Thanh Thai. On the day of the match, a female elephant fearlessly
walked into the arena, wandering before a tiger. Having observed the
elephantâ€™s attitude, Thanh Thai offered the compliment â€˜What a brave
thing!â€™ As the Emperor finished his words, the tiger jumped on to the
elephantâ€™s forehead. The elephant shook her head strongly, throwing the
tiger to the ground. The tiger made another jump and got on to the elephant in
the same place. The elephant roared and ran to the wall of the arena and with
all her might pushed the tiger against the wall. The angry tiger was one more
time thrown down to the ground, this time crushed.  
Há»• Quyá»n was more or less abandoned after that and has remained so. One of
the reasons was that economical difficulty stopped the budget for hunting
tigers and elephants for the fights. Another reason was that tension between
Emperor Thanh Thai and the colonial government had become more serious and so
there was no longer the mood for the fights.  
The architecture of Há»• Quyá»n arena is simple and strong. The materials are
brick, stone and cement. The arena is still in good condition after 182 years.  
The arena has no roof and is circular. The circumference is 140 m and diameter
44 m. There is special place for the King. There are five cages where the
tigers were kept before the matches. The field is round and planted with
grass.  
According to thinking during the Nguyen Dynasty, the elephant was royal,
strong and useful, whereas the tiger was a threat to people. At the fights,
the elephants always had to win and kill the tigers. Before a match, the
tigers had their fangs and claws removed. A match went until the tigers were
dead.

There are nine million motorbikes in Saigon. There can possibly be no quicker
escape from the noise, pollution and general irritation they cause than this.
It is just an hour and fifteen minute flight from HCMC to Danang. Both cities
have their airports jammed right against them so no long trips into town. At
Danang airport I jumped into a car and was driven through comparatively empty
streets and then alongside the scenic Han River spanned by new bridges. We
turned left at its mouth to follow the course of beautiful Danang Bay. Right
on the outskirts of town the red tile roofs of the Red Beach Hotel came into
view. Mountains and sea were all around. The Hai Van Pass loomed in the
heavens directly in front of me. Within half an hour of landing I found myself
seated in a deck chair on the balcony of my upper floor villa room with only
the trees for companions and overlooking lawns and two large ponds. It was
early evening and the only sounds were the constant chirping of cicadas and
the periodic rousing choruses of croaking frogs. Paradise regained!  
My reverie was broken by the phone ringing. Miss Ngoc Bich, the vice director,
was calling to invite me to dinner at the beachfront restaurant. Soon we were
seated at a table with sea breeze blowing. Our fellow diners were large groups
of Vietnamese families. Many more locals were enjoying beach activities or in
the swimming pool. It was Sunday and packed. Some were from town but others
had flown in for the fun from Hanoi or HCMC.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_0322---Le-Belhamy-resor.jpg)

The first dish to arrive was new to me â€“ sticky rice stuffed with slices of
succulent chicken breast. Quite tasty. The main dish was more familiar. A
whole large steamed grouper fish, head body and tail. There were green
vegetables and slices of raw young banana and rice paper, indications of a
roll your own feast. Miss Ngoc Bich could hardly suppress her laughter as I
wrapped pieces of fish and foliage into clumsy fat wads. Despite not having
mastered this art I really enjoyed the meal. I was offered dessert but elected
to finish in traditional style with fresh fruit. I mentioned a famous Danang
fish noodle dish I was anxious to try namely â€˜mi quang caâ€™, Miss Ngoc Bich
enquired of the smiling young waiters if this would be available for
breakfast. â€˜Only the pork versionâ€™, came the reply. â€˜Do not worryâ€™,
said Ngoc Bich, â€˜I will take you to the best place in town to try this for
breakfast. I should like you to meet my brother-in-law there too. He runs the
company which owns the hotel.â€™  
I stayed up late glued to the TV to find out which of the two Manchester teams
would win the Premier League. This was only decided in the dying moments of
stoppage time after which I slept like a baby. I awoke shortly after dawn.
Rousing revolutionary music was playing over a public address and
announcements were being made which, thankfully perhaps, my knowledge of
Vietnamese did not extend to my understanding. More comforting was the moaning
and rattling of a train making its way through the suburbs.  
There was time to observe guests eating their buffet breakfasts. It was
largely local breakfast fare on offer but there were also a few western things
such as ham, jam and bread. Miss Ngoc Bich arrived and whisked me off to the
Trum Lam Vien (Bamboo Garden Restaurant) restaurant in town. And a lovely
leafy place it was too with its large size bonsais, caged birds tweeting and
pond. The dainty dish of strip noodles covered in chopped peanuts and spring
onions made a mouth watering alternative breakfast to the more well known
â€˜pho noodle soupâ€™. The fish used is snake head marinated in seasoning and
water. The bones and head are ground and filtered with water to make the
stock. Herbs such as coriander, bean sprouts and chopped banana bulbs are
lastly added. I can recommend seeking out a bowl of these rice noodles to any
visitor to Danang as a must do.  
Just after it had been served Ngoc Bichâ€™s brother-in-law Nguyen Dinh Chien
chairman of the â€˜Thanh Datâ€™, which is the company owning the hotel,
arrived. He is an enthusiastic man of around 40 brimming with ideas and
expressing them in rapid fire Vietnamese which left me struggling to
comprehend. Luckily Ngoc Bich was there for interpretation. I was put into the
picture. The hotel had been taken over by â€˜Thanh Datâ€™ in December 2011. I
had noticed some alterations going on relating to the buildings. The hotelâ€™s
name has been changed to â€˜The Natureâ€™ although â€˜Red Beachâ€™ signs have
not yet been taken down. The general plan is to use the remaining land to
build time share villas, a small shopping centre, and some entertainment
facilities. I was asked if I could provide a slogan for the new complex. I
thought long and hard. The best I could come up with was â€˜Shop, Drop, Play
and Stayâ€™.  
Then it was back to the resort where they had wanted me to sample the
â€˜Spaâ€™. There was however only time for an inspection. I am able to report
to you that they have the â€˜worksâ€™ here. Besides a sauna, steam bath,
jacuzzi and a 24 place massage parlour there is also a foot massage room and a
full treatment beauty salon.  
Soon a car had arrived and it was time to start out for the next destination
on my mission- the museum port city of Hoi An. And so it was that with
friendly reception staff waving farewell that I took my leave of this fair
hostelry.

Just as Shakespeare never ate a potato chip and the Romans did not know what a
tomato was, the dragon fruit has only a short history in  
Vietnam. It was introduced barely a hundred years ago by the French, from its
native Central America or Colombia, and not as food but as a decorative plant.  
What is now known in Vietnam as the dragon fruit is a cactus with an odd but
beautiful fruit and is normally the size of a hand grenade. In Asian languages
the name usually translates as â€˜dragonâ€™. You can see the resemblance, with
the red body and tapering streaks of hard, green foliage. The Chinese call it
either â€˜fire dragonâ€™ or â€˜dragon pearl fruitâ€™. It could be taken for an
Olympic mascot. â€˜Strawberry pearâ€™ and â€˜cinderella plantâ€™ represent
further notions. Latin calls it Hylocereus, from the words for â€˜matterâ€™
and â€˜waxâ€™. Added to this area number of names that refer to the fact that
it blooms at night. It takes just one night for the pretty, white-and-yellow
flower to emerge, which earns epithets like â€˜mooonflowerâ€™, â€˜ladyâ€™ or
â€˜belleâ€™ of the night and â€˜rainha da noiteâ€™, in Portuguese, which
translates as â€˜queen of the nightâ€™.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/4909201211---Thanh-long---D.jpg)

There are three varieties, Hylocereus undatus, the most common, which produces
white-fleshed fruit, H. polyrhizus, which has a deep-red or purplish flesh and
Selinacereus megalanthus, which has a yellow skin rather than the magenta of
the other two but with white flesh. The last one I have not seen in Vietnam
but did encounter in the Jardin Exotique in Monaco.  
Whilst you may find them in the Mekong Delta, the main area of cultivation of
the dragon fruit in Vietnam is in one of its driest partâ€™s, the south of
Binh Thuan Province, just south of the city of Phan Thiet. Trained on concrete
posts and standing in regimented lines, they are the outstanding feature of
the countryside here. They have many more arms, dark green, than an octopus,
drooping down. We have one grown from a cutting in our Saigon terrace garden
and it is fun to follow its meanderings along the security meshings. A
drunkard wandering home at night in the countryside might mistake one for a
hairy monster. Don Quixote, had he come across a field of them on his travels,
might well have taken them for an invading alien army and tilted at them.  
My sister-in-lawâ€™s house lies a hundred metres or so down a beaten earth
track off National Highway 1 in the village of XÃ£ HÃ m Minh, about 25
kilometres from south of Phan Thiet. With its warehouses, this village is an
important collection point for this region of dragon fruit. The house itself
and those of its dispersed neighbours is immersed in its dragon-fruit orchard.
As we arrived, the family was busy taking down long lines of electric bulbs
from the fields. Operated by a generator, these give night-time light in order
to encourage early budding. I was quite relieved they were not going to be
used on this visit as on previous ones, when I had been kept awake at night by
the noise of the machine. Now the only thing to disturb me at night might be
the yapping of the guard dog. Tethered beside the outdoor toilet, he dutifully
growled at me as I went to relief myself.  
The night seemingly passed without incident as I slept like a log. However, at
breakfast the talk was about an overnight dognapping. My wife had been
awakened by barking but thought little of it. How callous, I thought, to whisk
away the guardian of Vietnamâ€™s most iconic fruit. There were two theories
for the motive. The first was that the thief might be eliminating security in
preparation for a raid on the house some other night. The second and much more
sinister was that the dog had been stolen to be served up with rice.  
After breakfast brother-in-law Anh Thu led me off on a tour of the premises.
First, we passed the livestock area, where he pointed out the ducks and
chickens, which he noted were fed partly on discarded dragon fruit. That would
account for their mouthwatering, tender quality, I conjectured. Then, walking
through the rows of cacti, he held back a branch. Unlike on most cacti, there
were many spines. He pointed to the nodules and explained that at each point a
fruit would bud twice a year. At any one time only a couple of the ten or more
nodules on each branch would bear fruit. This way the farmer gets a constant
harvest. From planting it takes only two years to bear the first fruit and a
cactus can stay productive for up to twenty five years. In this way the farmer
gets a quick return on investment and usually a steady year-round income.
â€˜The only problem at the moment,â€™ Anh Thu sighed, â€˜is that the price is
low.â€™  
Much of the produce of my sister-in-lawâ€™s farm is sold on the domestic
market but, as Anh Thu explained, the dragon fruit is a very significant
earner of foreign currency for Vietnam. They are much appreciated in Taiwan
and Japan. Chinese middlemen, according to Anh Thu, sell them on to the USA.,
where, as in Europe, a smaller version is preferred. Being English, I checked
with sources at home to discover that a single fruit is sold for between £1.50
(around VND48,000) and £1.95 (around VND60,000) in London supermarkets. When I
told this to Anh Thu the eyes nearly popped out of his head.  
The uses and benefits of the fruit are manifold. I recently did a little
experiment. I tasted together a shop-bought fruit and one just picked off the
vine that grows naturally in our garden. My opinion is subjective, of course,
but to my mind, at least in this case, modern farming methods do not produce
better flavour. Furthermore, the home-grown one had many more seeds in it and
these are important not only for the palate but provide fibre and protein. The
Vitamin C content is high and among the many health benefits claimed for the
regular eater is a lowering in blood glucose levels for type 2 diabetes. The
reddish-purplish-fleshed variety had the added benefit of aiding blood-flow.
The fruit can be juiced, fermented, or made part of a fruit cocktail. It goes
particularly well with mango juice. My ever-inventive wife not only serves it
the latter way but uses it as an ingredient for an excellent fruit punch using
rÆ°á»£u gáº¡o (rice liquor) as a base. Of course, as with all fruit, you can
make jam with it. But I have never tried that.  
If you are new to this somewhat unusual fruit I hope the next time you see it
in a market you will not hesitate to try it. If you do not particularly like
it first time, persevere, as it can be an acquired taste.  
Finally do please say a little prayer for the dog. He has gone missing
presumed eaten, all in the cause of duty to his country whilst protecting one
of Vietnamâ€™s adopted icons and its top fruit export.

11/20/2019,Where all paths lead to Home,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/where-all-paths-lead-to-home/,,By Ho Dang Thanh Ngoc,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/ngo%20AnHien2%20By%20Ho%20Dang%20Thanh%20Ngoc%20copy.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/ngo-Kim-LOng1-By-Ho-Dang-Th.jpg,"_(No.3, Vol.3, Apr 2013 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

Perhaps one of the most impressive, peaceful, and profoundly captivating of
things is the tranquil greenness of the numerous ngÃµ, or entrance paths, of
homes and neighbourhoods in Hue.  
The small entrance paths meander on as profusely as nostalgia, as if to allow
sufficient time for people to contemplate alongside the surrounding fruit
trees, as if to interweave nebulous, entangled emotions along the paths of
life, as if to allow somebody out there to go on longing for someone with each
and every step on the return home some day long ago.  
When speaking of green, quiet entrance paths, perhaps Hue is most replete with
the verdant enchantment that lends people such idyllic sensations. Having
lived in Hue for a long time, I am yet still mystified by the little entrance
paths in Hue. I feel as if they were a thread binding the spirit of Hue to
life far and wide. The thread is woven with leaves and mist, and intertwined
therein are simple echoes from gardens and even the modest light of time, of
the landscape and space of Hue. It is all woven together by the hand of a mind
full of a sensitivity that is at once silent and mossy and as vibrant as the
wind through a bamboo forest.  
The people of Hue often say, â€˜In the home, out in the entrance path,â€™ and
indeed, an entrance path of a home or a neighbourhood is like the preface of a
book or the beginning of a story.

Hue people often consider that in their traditional three-compartment, two-
wing homes, the middle compartment is always for venerating the ancestral
tablet, the right compartment is for worshiping the earth gods (land and
gardens), and that the compartment on the left is the place set aside for the
Kitchen God, and for the women who take care of the kitchen. Thus, an entrance
path leading up straight towards the middle compartment must be avoided. If
the layout offers no choice, then a screen is necessary to block it [from
leading directly to the middle compartment]. After that, a connection path
must be made that turns towards the right compartment. Only estates of kings,
lords, and noble families have an entrance paths leading to the middle
compartment. The majority of entrance paths of hundreds of aristocratic
estates in Hue are such that the entrance path opens directly towards the
middle compartment, while a screen is built at the end to block it. It is
taboo for the entrance path to lead directly to the left compartment, where
there kitchen is. This arrangement also owes itself to Hue peopleâ€™s belief
that for the entrance path to lead to the right compartment is to esteem
guests, while an entrance path leading to the left compartment is for nothing
more than for domestic animals (buffalo and cattle) to come and go. Gates are
usually roofed so that passers-by may take shelter from the sun and rain.  
The way entrance paths are positioned in Hue is a reminder to her folks that,
whenever one heads out, there is a right and wrong, a front and back; that
whenever one steps out to do business in life towards fame and success, that
one not forget the clustered neighbourhood on the very ground that afforded
one a home and that one not follow after the worldâ€™s expression â€˜the homes
are near, but the entrance paths are farâ€™ and end up keeping to oneself with
oneâ€™s gates shut tight and oneâ€™s walls towering high.  
As a saying goes: â€˜Evening after evening, I stand out in the rear entrance
path and long for my hometownâ€¦â€™ In the past, Hue girls, when they were
married to a far away husband and thus had to live far away from their birth
place, often turned to the rear entrance paths to assuage the lamentable fate
of becoming a daughter-in-law, their furtive tears falling to the areca trees,
to groves of banana, and falling down to the damp, mossy earth.

Beside the entrance paths of homes are those of the neighbourhood. Usually,
neighbourhood entrance paths are planted with bamboo and rows of glistening,
verdant areca, while home entrance paths are planted with Chinese tea and
hibiscus. Whether at the end of a home entrance path where it connects with
the neighbourhood or at the end of a neighbourhood entrance path, where it
meets the road to the village, thereâ€™s always a three-way intersection
spacious enough for neighbourhood youngsters to gather and play, a place for
adults to meet, share in betel, and converse.

Quite common it is to see freelance masseurs at work on beaches in Thailand.
At Mui Ne, the hotels tend to  
have their own semi-private sections of beach and this seldom occurs. Many
people feel that proximity to the infinite lapping of waves and the calming
effect of a sea breeze is something that adds to a massage experience. I am
happy to report that this is actually available at this most popular
Vietnamese beach resort and at a very professional and organized level too.
â€˜Forester Spaâ€™ operates from the palm-lined gardens of The Sunshine View
Hotel and has two other branches, one of which is a little further along the
main â€˜stripâ€™ near the Allez Boo Hotel. I went along to test out their
expertise, accompanied by my wife and teenage daughter, for whom this was to
be a first-time adventure.  
You are right on the seashore, but there is something of the atmosphere of a
minority mountain village here too. The massage rooms are housed in frame huts
made of bamboo and lattice work. You may think that lying face down for around
an hour looking through a hole in the massage bed at a small bowl of water
with a lotus flower in it would be a tad boring. However, the background
meditation music and wafts of citrus from the body oil set my mind on a dreamy
course and the time just flew past.  
There is a long â€˜menuâ€™ from which to select your treatments, all of which
purport to provide specific benefits for your skin, body and mind. Three work
on your face-aloe vera, purifying and mud. The first of these two materials
are also featured as wraps in the full body section, which also includes the
organic scrub and the â€˜after sportâ€™ for the fitness-minded, and the third
uses the curiously named â€˜azial body oil.â€™ Lastly there is a list of
massage therapies, from which I chose the â€˜Aromatherapyâ€™ and the girls the
â€˜Relaxing Massageâ€™.  
Rubbing, pressing, pommeling, chopping, twisting and turning are the gerunds
that could sum up the actions that will be applied to your carcass. My massage
lasted ninety minutes, the duration of a soccer match, but this was no
goalless draw. There were moments of ecstasy and if not agony, certainly
bemusement. There were frissons even of fear when my forehead received a good
hard chopping. â€˜Good heavensâ€™, I thought, â€˜I am at the mercy of a
masseuse who could take my life with one karate chop.â€™  
The girlsâ€™ massage lasted the length of a short feature film – one hour-so
they were waiting for me as I stepped out of the A frame, a new man. The wife
was quite silent, even blasÃ©, about the experience. She is something of an
amateur masseuse herself. Once she applied her â€˜skillsâ€™ on me when I had a
bad back due to poor sleeping posture. I was cured but that was more down to
drinking a few glasses of her excellent medicinal wine. The active ingredient
of this concoction, dear reader, is certain unprintable body parts of a cat. I
was only informed of this after I was cured! My daughterâ€™s comment on the
massage was, â€˜It tickledâ€™. She certainly did look quite tickled pink.  
This is an advertorial and it behooves me to trumpet the news of other
services available at â€˜Foresterâ€™. They have a sauna and steam bath which,
for a fee, you are allowed to frolic in for a limitless time. There are all
the services you can expect from a beauty parlour and men and ladiesâ€™
hairdressing. If you are interested in having the â€˜whole caboodleâ€™ at a
reasonable price, there are indulgence and beauty packages where you can get,
for example, a body massage, a foot massage and a facial.  
In my day, it used to be that donkey rides, sand castles and sticks of rock
were the essentials of a holiday by the sea. Nowadays it seems a massage is a
must-do part of the relaxation and there are plenty of places in Mui Ne to get
one. No doubt most of them are very professional, but it would be hard to beat
the â€˜Foresterâ€™ for overall atmosphere and excellent service. They
certainly toned up my weary flab. One thing is for sure, it is easier to find
a massage in Mui Ne than it is to find a bar that serves up a decent flagon of
cat wine. â€˜Just as wellâ€™, I hear you say!

11/20/2019,Treading upon a fading faraway railway,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/treading-upon-a-fading-faraway-railway/,,Text by Nguyen Hang Tinh and photos by Nguyen Huu Thanh,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-(6).jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-(8).jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-(7).jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-(10).jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-(11).jpg,"_(No.11, Vol.3, Dec 2013 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-\(6\).jpg)_

Sitting on Dalatâ€™s remaining train line for a space of time not even
equivalent to that of sitting for half a cup of black coffee, I finally
understood the avuncular train conductor, about why he is always in such a
state, conserving each and every centimeter. The tourist railcar is designed
to look like the one that used to run in Dalat, while the locomotive that runs
on diesel fuel and was built in the Soviet era is of the type that is no
longer seen throughout the rest of the domestic railway system. The locomotive
was brought in up from the delta. It is just seven kilometers from the only
station in the country to be ranked as national architectural and cultural
heritage to the Trai Mat area, from precinct nine across to precinct 11 and
that is all. It is just one stretch of track, enough to render it remote in
the manner of the precipitous villages along the hillsideâ€” just one stretch
of track, enough to make the whistle of the train turn grayâ€” just one
stretch of track, enough to drag history into the world of Dalat.  
That train journey shorter than the space of a cup of black coffee evokes a
sense of being suddenly cut off, and of choking the heart. Thus I tortured
myself by sauntering on along the old tracks, on the obscure rail-bed of the
rack railway that used to spout steam, ran on a steam engine, and traversed
the misty mountainous roads from the Trai Mat area. I went on the road that,
over twenty years ago, before coming to Dalat to take my university entrance
exams, I, as a naÃ¯ve student, looked for a national travel map with which to
pick out the locations, roads, and means of transportation. There, the places
marked on the map indicated the national railroad system, so that one still
saw clearly the railroad lines from Phan Rang on the central coast up to
mountainous Dalat printed boldly in red. Nevertheless, that day, when I
requested that the cutest lady at the Danang station sell me a train ticket to
Dalat, she said, â€˜On the map the railway lines are just recorded that way,
but those lines are not in operation. The railways there have already
disappeared!â€™  
I searched for the road that would connect my memories and imagination with
reality, despite the fading obscurity of reality in the Langbian highlands.
Nature, hills, mountains, and the pine forest that runs downstream towards
Song Pha Pass, owing to their having not yet been infused with the flavour of
real estate, still roll on endlessly and remain peaceful and verdant, as if
they were the corners of the last figure of the serene mountain plateau
itself. Thereabouts, stretches of vegetation blanket over each visible
manifestation of the marvelous iron tracks, which loftily and audaciously
traverse through the mountains. Thereabouts, sections have been reborn as
gardens for mocha coffee, persimmons, legumes and tens of thousands of black
mangroves, broccoli, potatoes, and carrots. The Vietnamese people never cease
to crave land, so any place that is easy to obtain they invade, any place that
is empty they jump upon, and any place that is wild, they clear away for
cultivation. Thereabouts, stretches of countryside streets, along with
matchbox ferroconcrete houses popped up to supplant the former incarnation of
the meagre railroad. A few dilapidated stations of nineteenth-century French
architecture still unabashedly survive in Xuan Tho, Cau Dat, and Tram Hanh.
Tent setups have also squeezed in and surround them. The impoverished masses
immediately jumped into them for shelter. Deserted houses are left wide open,
even more so than Buddhist pagodas. As an unbridled errant of this region, I
love and understand the destitute people and the dregs of society. The carved
statue at the head of Song Pha Pass is reserved for extolling railroad workers
who, because of their struggle for the sake of the Phan Rang-Dalat rack
railway and justice, died one day. The sculpture was erected solemnly as some
sculptor carved, holding back his magnanimous will to embrace the hands of the
chained slaves. The descendants of a number of former railway workers now
continue to struggle with mocha coffee trees as well as Cau Dat tea plants, or
they plant edible persimmon fruits, pineapples, and vegetables on the two
sides of the vestiges of the Dran railroad bridge.  
My emotions became ever more lonesome each time I squeezed into sections of
the frigid, quiet and deserted tunnels. In the darkness, the people cannot
occupy them and the authorities do not bother with them anymore, so they
became desolate tunnels that fill with water in the rainy season and are a
habitat for snakes, centipedes, and jungle beasts during the dry season. The
long-winding curved concrete dome roof flickered with light that slipped in
from the ends of the tunnels, now adorned with lichen and ferns that rendered
them inanimate and mysterious. During the period in the early part of the
previous century, when the degree of engineering science and mechanical
equipment were quite limited, to have bored into the mountains to create
tunnels through them for everyone to travel to and fro in such a way was
indeed horribly amazing. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
when Vietnamese education still laboured at poetry and struggled in a backward
delirium with the antiquated writings of Confucian sages, the Five Confucian
Classics, and the Analects of Confucius alongside mathematics, physics, and
chemistry, history naturally projected the appearance of civil engineering
works associated with a crowd of highly skilled ordinary citizens. I cried
out, â€˜Ohhhhhhâ€¦.. raaaaaaaaccckkkkâ€¦ raaaaillwaaaaaaay!â€™

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-\(8\).jpg)_

It would have been truly hard for me not to take interest in that time when
people from Dalat, Phan Rang, and Nha Trang glided by on the beloved train
through the rolling terrain along a range of hills lined with a succession of
verdant pine trees above and the long-winding cool earth beneath. As for the
sound emitted on the railroad, it, too, differed from that of the railway that
runs north and south along the seacoast below, because it rattles in quietude.
When the train climbs a steep mountain pass, every single step weighs upon it
as it strains itself, locks on to the cog track, and clings tightly, while
sparks frequently coruscate beneath the tracks because of the heavy friction
on the metal. To this very day in Dalat, with any mention of the railway the
Dalat people smack their lips, especially those who have plied back and forth
on this railroad track, which I refer to as the â€˜railway that connects the
sea to the flowers.â€™ Some recall vividly, others only vaguely, but all want
to talk about it. They describe it such that you are captivated as you hear
about the characteristic sound of the cramp iron bearing down on the cog track
that is exclusive to their homeland. They cause you to rack your brains,
imagining something that is an actuality, the scene of the train climbing from
the low-land Phan Rang at the foot of Song Pha Pass up to an elevation of
1,200m and then 1,500m above sea level. They render you speechless about the
railway that pierces on through the brume at moments when the entire highlands
are submerged in mist. They say that the pine forest is paradise and that
travellers on the train drift through that ethereal pine forest. Every day,
the train zips from the lands inundated with sunrays on the seacoast, meanders
through the twisted mountainside straits of wide-leaved forest in Song Pha
Pass, and then enters the limpid pine forest and submerges into the frigidness
of the highlands. And then back again. In the memories of many a person are
images from the train car window of the tropical countryside, followed a few
hours later by an immediate encounter with the temperate countryside, as the
immense view is constantly and suddenly cut off and obscured by the mountains
and hills.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/huuthanh-\(7\).jpg)_

Such sensations are not of this century, but rather right from the 30s of the
previous century on up to the 1970s. That is the era in which the railway came
to be and appeared on the journey from the Thap Cham (now Phan Rang â€“Thap
Cham City or better known as Phan Rang) to Dalat. The history of world
railways clearly highlights it as one of the three first rack railways in the
world.  
The more I tread upon the fading obscurity of the Dalat-Thap Cham railway, the
more I slip into rue. I know that if the railway were to still exist, then
Dalat tourism would not be merely as it is now. And not only tourism, but the
entire economy and the picture of society of Dalat and Phan Rang would also be
completely different in many ways. Excessive pride, chronic extreme
willfulness, and the destructive might of benightedness are often quite
terrifying when they not only cause material loss, but also the extirpation of
even the spirit and the fruits of labor. Perhaps in the history of railroading
in Vietnam there will be no weighty, abstruse, and strange as that generated
by the decision of the Vietnamese Railway Enterprise Union in Hanoi during the
dry season of 1976 to allow people to pour in and dismantle the Thap Cham-
Dalat railroad. There is no railway only eighty-four kilometres long, yet
required thirty-three years of ongoing construction like this railway that
connects the sea to the marvellous mountains. Were the French crazy when, in
1908, they built this railway from an elevation of 3m to that of an elevation
of 1,500m-1,650m above sea level? The lonesome, solitary railroad that ascends
the highlands and breaks away from the main railway axis that runs through the
country along the East Sea has its own life and is immensely special, as it
even has poetry dedicated to it, owing precisely to the cold like that of the
tunnels that traverse silhouettes of the pine forest: â€˜Digging two
kilometers into the tunnelâ€™s mouth/ the people wasted away, eating and
sleeping in the wind and mist/ Some collapsed in the earth, others crushed to
the bones/ Some were hit by a detonation that shredded their bones and
pulverized their skulls/ Speaking of it some were dismal, others sorrowful. To
die in vain, the profound death of the spirit…â€™ (Excerpt from the anonymous
poem â€˜The Life of the Coolieâ€™).  
The railroad fading faraway on which Iâ€™ve lost my way today is simpler than
at the critical period in history not too long ago. It is the railroad of
trade in vegetable, flowers, fruits, lumber, firewood, aromatic scents, as
well as salted fish, rice and paddy, and agricultural and construction
materials between Dalat and Phan Rang and Nha Trang. For a period of time, all
the heavy goods that came up from Saigon and down from the highlands were
transported to and fro via the rattling that issued from the special rack
railway. It is not just a railway, but also a part of the material and
spiritual heritage that tamed the Langbian highlands and the sweat and tears
of the people. And only then did everything fade into the past, blurring the
myriad mountainous, and the sylvan roads.  
Sitting in the old deserted railroad tunnel, I recalled a draft of a photo
album by the photographic artist Tam Thai named â€˜The Olden Days in
Langbianâ€¦ Dalatâ€™ (Ngay xua Langbianâ€¦ Dalat). In the draft, I was
startled when I looked at the photographs of the Dalat peopleâ€™s cog railway,
of the Furka brand locomotive, which used to be the pride of all humanity
during the industrial revolution in Europe and was manufactured by the Swiss.
Heaven endowed me with sufficient memory to recall the simplest of things, so
I remember that in the early 1990â€™s, it was none other than the Swiss who
came to Vietnam in search of those locomotives to purchase and bring back as
keepsakes. The records of the railway industry and the current government also
record that those locomotives were sold as scrap iron. Looking at the
photographs of the olden days that my friend had collected, I saw the train
rushing headlong on the cog railway of bygone days and was speechless as if I
had met an old friend from this native land in the flesh. Oh, Tam Thai! You
live on the faraway Mekong Delta, why on earth do you so concern yourself with
recondite tales of these frigid highlands? And how to forget Mr Che Dang, a
communist revolutionary in Area VI, now deceased, who once told me about the
tears that fell to the train tracks as he resigned himself to stand
confoundedly on the day he witnessed the scene of people pouring in to
dismantle the railway? At one time, labourers built it; and at another, they
dismantled it. Mr Che Dang expressed his true feelings, â€˜If that day we had
been more courageous and resolute, perhaps we couldâ€™ve saved the railroad.
They said that they were taking the scrap iron back to make the North-South
Railway, but the structures of the two kinds of railway differ!â€™ He also
said that during the war, when he organized the fighting, he always instructed
his compatriots to avoid damaging the railway â€˜so that after the
reunification it could still be used to develop the homeland.â€™ Down in Ninh
Thuan, when Ms Hoang Thi Ut Lan was the chairwoman of the provincial
peopleâ€™s committee, the female official often expressed to me her craving to
â€˜connect Ninh Thuan to Dalat through the railroadâ€™ as she had seen in her
youth. â€˜If we had that railway, Ninh Thuan would no longer be just a place
for people to glide right by. Even tourism would surely develop from
qualitative interaction with Dalat between the value of the sea and the value
of the flowers,â€™ she said.  
Not long ago, on the dreary Dalat platform with a small staff to to operate
the 7km of train track there, accidentally, I met a second character from
Vietnamese railroading and listened to him convey, as we sat on the remaining
stretch of railroad, that â€˜Itâ€™s a weird feeling, quite different sitting
on the trains that run down there (in the delta)!â€™  
Gently, I asked him, â€˜Do you guys mean to make amends regarding it, the only
cog railway in the country, for a burden of debt to the people of Dalat?â€™  
The deputy director-general let out the words, â€˜Surely weâ€™ll just have to
rebuild it, because Dalatâ€™s tourist potential is so great!â€™ Iâ€™ll never
forget the moment he mused with sincerity of feeling, â€˜But I donâ€™t know
where weâ€™ll ever find a source of capital in order to pull it off!â€™
Rehearsing the scene above, in April, at the Economic and Social Development
of the Central Highlands Conference in Gia Lai, the Minister of Planning and
Investment Bui Quang Vinh, mentioned the need to have a railway line from the
Thap Cham to Dalat when he spoke of the construction investment strategy to
develop the region.  
Documents show that from the year 1939, many newspapers in France and Annam
(now Vietnam) popularized Dalat as a tourism area. Vietnamese newspapers the
other day published an essay by a female Vietnamese tourist who told of the
extraordinary sensation of sitting on a Furka steam locomotive in a
mountainous region in Switzerland that was being propagated as a locomotive
that the Swiss bought as â€˜scrap ironâ€™ in Vietnamâ€™s Dalat.  
The life of man is odd like that! At times we destroy that which we have, only
to then long for the money to redo that which weâ€™ve destroyed.  
Stepping out of another tunnel of the old railroad, I stood right at the end
of the tunnel and cried out, â€˜Rack railwayâ€¦!â€™ The sound was not as
resounding, but the echo was still as of old, â€˜Raaaccckkkk raaaaaaiiiilll
wwwaaaaaa yyyyyyyy!â€™

An explorer from the British Cave Research Association (BCRA) told me,
â€˜Quang Binh has an open cast â€œgold mine,â€ a natural heritage of
extremely intricate cave systems. Properly exploited, this site would be a
world-famous caving centre.â€™  
In June 2012, I came back to the Truong Son Range in the Central Province of
Quang Binh with a group of explorers from the BCRA, who are looking for new
caves to add to the caving â€˜gold mineâ€™ of Quang Binh. The expedition took
place in the Tu Lan Valley of the Minh Hoa area. Howard Limbert, the BCRA team
leader said, â€˜Finding new caves is becoming increasingly difficult, because
they are further away. Sometimes it takes four to five days of hiking to find
the entrance.â€™  
The wilderness potentially always holds unexpected perils for cave explorers.
Treacherous paths, rugged terrain, dangerous animals such as snakes and even
the vegetable cover can cause trouble in most unexpected ways. Howard warned
me about a lush, green plant named â€˜Second Ladyâ€™ that grows everywhere and
seems to invite one to touch its white, smooth hair. But doing so causes a
very unpleasant burning sensation. Howard instructed me that if I touched
these leaves, I should not wash or scratch, but cover the touched spot with a
palm leaf and wipe myself down to remove those white hairs from the skin.  
On the way, I was mesmerized by thick flocks of colourful butterflies. But in
the forest, beauty is often deceitful. Howard fell victim during a break while
drying his stuff. The butterflies came and left pollen in his shoes and socks
that caused him a lot of pain.

**Beauty, danger and wonder in the big caves at Quang Binh  
**  
In this expedition, we explored two new caves, introduced by the locals as Uoi
Cave and Ken Cave. To get to Uoi, we had to go through the Chuot Cave, which
is over one kilometre long. Walking in the dark, I felt cool breezes-meaning
that the cave led to a big exit. Another familiar signature feature of the
Quang Binh caves was that there were many fish and clam fossils on the cave
walls, beside the stalagmites and stalactites. In those caves with strong
ventilation, the stalactites often grow layers of very hard moles. Howard
called them â€˜cave popcornâ€™.  
The way to Uoi was not easy at all. We had to slash our way through the thick
brush. The entrance is at a mountain top. We lost our way many times, although
led by local guides. Not until late in the afternoon did we come to the
entrance. Looking from afar, Howard remarked, â€˜This must be a big one.â€™ I
didnâ€™t understand, and he explained, â€˜In my 20 yearsâ€™ experience of cave
exploration in Quang Binh, if you see trees with big leaves at the entrance,
then itâ€™s a big one.â€™  
The explorers got to work immediately. Martin Holroyd made a spreadsheet to
create a detailed chart of the exploration. Howard prepared a laser gauge.
Another team member was Martin Colledge, a specialist of forest road design.
Technical data on height, width and depth of every metre in the cave was
noted. Deep in the cave, I realized that Howardâ€™s prediction was correct.
Cave Uoi was very wide, breathtakingly beautiful, with countless colourful
stalactites; but the most striking feature was the pearl carpet. Big and
small, they covered the cave floor. Howard was delighted, â€˜This is the
specialty of Quang Binh caves. In Son Doong, there are pearls as big as a
fist. The ones here are smaller, but still very big compared to those found
elsewhere. In England, some caves that I have explored also have pearls of
this kind, but they are only as big as the tip of a chopstick, not big like
these.â€™  
A little over 500m inside, the passage was suddenly obstructed by a sheer
stalactite wall. On one side, there was an abyss so deep the bottom couldnâ€™t
be seen in the torch light. After a few minutes, Howard found a man-sized
hole. Howard strapped himself and disappeared behind the hole, followed by
Martin. My heart pounding, I also grabbed the strap and crawled through.
Suddenly, my hair stood up. I had narrowly escaped a free fall, thanks to the
safety strap. I skirted along the stone wall to a vast vault, captivated by
the thrill of true cave exploration

The â€˜Duxtonâ€™ is not to be missed. It is the beige-and-white hotel toward
the harbour end of Saigonâ€™s chic and famous Nguyen Hue boulevard. Behind the
huge black screen with Chinese characters at the end of the bright and airy
lobby, there lies quite a culinary experience. If you hanker for a banquet
that features luxury food from both land and ocean and at an affordable price,
then here is where you will find it. The stars of this dinner banquet are
undoubtedly the succulent beef raised on the prairies of the United States and
the lobster sourced mainly from Maine. The restaurant which also offers an
â€˜a la carteâ€™ menu is simply called â€˜The Grillâ€™.  
For the diner, the buffet is not as easy as it looks. All the decisions are
yours. In the past, I have always followed the golden rule taken from the
rubric of examinations-â€˜Attempt allâ€™. This is particularly appropriate in
Vietnam, where in Vietnamese, the word â€˜monâ€™ but with slightly different
diacriticals, means both dish and school subject. But now, in middle age, the
questions of what combines with what and what is best for the health becomes
more difficult. I started with a traditional bread roll and butter, together
with Japanese sushi and sashimi. I chose morsels of herring, salmon and egg,
which was not a bad kick off. It was not only tasty, but it sparked off the
taste buds.

**If you hanker for a banquet that features luxury food from both land and

**

Ours was a party of four. Sales and Marketing Manager Mr Dang Di Hieu was at
the table with his assistant Miss Bach Hoa Tranh. I had brought along my
teenage daughter. Mr Hieu explained a little bit about the hotel, which is
part of a Singaporean chain. He told us the buffet was available throughout
the day, so it is suitable for late breakfasters. Also, with a hundred and
twenty dining places, it can accommodate large groups. One interesting fact we
learned is that the hotel featured in the American Viet Kieu film â€˜Cycloâ€™.  
The dining hall is large, but the buffet is arranged centrally, so we had to
make only short trips to refill our plates. There is an attractive display of
sea food on a bed of ice at the entrance, from which I took a pair of raw
oysters; you can also have this delicacy baked in cheese. A line of chafing
dishes contain chicken, pork, fried rice, and vegetable dishes. I stocked up
on broccoli, cauliflower and my favourite veggie, courgettes (zucchinis). My
daughter remarking on how tasty they were had me add some chips to all this.
On to the salad section I chose the baby octopus salad. In an area of its own,
I took some melt-in-the-mouth slices of roast beef and served myself from a
whole steamed fish.  
The grill station is in a separate but close-to-hand area. There are pork
cuts, chicken breasts and sausages pork cuts. You can have your lobster cooked
in a number of ways: baked with garlic butter, in Singapore chilli and egg
sauce, stir- fried with tamarind sauce or cooked in Cajun spices. We had it in
the first- mentioned manner. Oh what fun we had cracking open the legs with
the nutcrackers provided! After the finger dips had arrived, I asked my
daughter what she thought of lobster, as this was her first time to enjoy it.
â€˜Quite nice, but I prefer crabâ€™, came the answer. I did not get to taste
such things until well into adulthood. The nearest I got was prawn cocktail.  
There were plenty of cakes, pastries, and fresh fruits to choose from for
dessert. I personally went for soft creamy French cheese with crackers, but I
got vicarious pleasure from watching my teenager stuff herself with mint and
chocolate ice cream encrusted with peanuts. Here a confession. My daughter
could not find room for the apple pie she had picked put so I polished it off
for her. I still have the taste of cloves and cinnamon on my lips.  
I know there are many great places in Saigon to enjoy a family or business
meal for much less money, but if you are the mood for a splurge and want to
eat food that you do not normally indulge in, the Duxton Hotel Saigon buffet
is a great choice. I hope this has whetted your appetite and perhaps you too
will be able to enjoy wondrous fruit of the ocean and the finest meat from the
grassland cooked and presented with care and style.

If you are flying into Con Dao, be sure to order a window seat. The approach
to landing is spectacular as you bank over the two of the largest outlying
islands and abruptly land on a runway that occupies the entire length of a
narrow neck of land. You will get a good view of Cay Bang town, the largest
settlement nestled in the widest bay with a backdrop of the dark verdure of
thick mountainous forest which has been declared a National Park.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Con-dao.jpg)

If you are reading this is in Saigon or in Hanoi, you might well judge this
paragraph to be the stuff of fantasy. But there does exist in Vietnam a town
so crime-free that people leave their motorbikes and front doors unlocked.
There exists in Vietnam a town, albeit a small one, so quiet that at midday,
that you can stand in the middle of a major thoroughfare without a single
vehicle passing you. In Saigon, there are whole districts without a single
green space. This town has well- tended gardens around pagodas, museums, its
market and its beachfront. Furthermore, any pollution is dissipated by the
constant sea breeze that wafts over it.  
Malabar Almond Tree Town (Thi Tran Cay Bang) is the translation of the
befittingly pretty name of this urbanisation. Some of eponymous trees have
blue plaques on them announcing â€˜Vietnam Heritage Treeâ€™. The stunning
setting of wide bay views, town beaches and mountain backdrop is reminiscent
of more famous places such as Rio de Janeiro or Cape Town.  
It had been four years since my last visit and there had been a number of
changes. The town now has traffic lights-not that the number of vehicles
justifies this. The local motorcyclists sometimes just do not quite seem to
know what to make of them, but then again, the same thing could be said of
those of Saigon! One set at a T junction next to our hotel is permanently set
at amber-superfluous and as if the Highway Code did not exist.  
In recent years, Con Dao has been acquiring something of a jet set image-a
reserve for the rich and famous. In fact, the opposite is true. It is now more
open to all pockets than it ever has been. When we first started to visit in
2002, there were only three real hotels to choose from. Back then there were
only three flights a week. Now, there four or five a day. The locals have
responded by opening up a half- dozen mini hotels and guest houses centred
around the market. Some of these get very good reviews on tourist web sites
and a decent clean room can be had for 300,000 dongs a night.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/CON-DAO-2-PANO-by-Le-Thang-
My.jpg)

Another new thing for us was the Night Market, which has sprung up on an
otherwise unfrequented street. We took a stroll to it for dinner one evening.
Unlike in Saigon, here you can walk freely without fear of falling into a pot
hole or having to clamber over thoughtlessly-parked motorbikes. However, at
one point, grazing cows did block the way. The night market itself is clean
and hygienic. The only parked vehicle we saw was the portaloo. There were
stalls selling various noodle soups, roast duck and various shellfish and
seafood dishes, and we opted to patronise the stall of a woman familiar to my
wife on previous trips from the day market. We ordered a whole chicken and my
wife worked with the owner to ensure it was served with salad and finely
chopped up according to central Vietnamese tastes. This, together, with bowls
of hu tieu the signature beef noodle soup of the South, plus copious drinks
served a family of four. The bill was around a mere 500,000 dongs. (just under
$25).  
Something else that was new is that the island now has a taxi service. This is
quite useful for the airport, which is twelve kilometres from town if you are
not staying at a major hotel, which will have its own transport. In the past,
our hotel provided bicycles, which given the short distances in Cay Bang, was
ideal. Now Saigon Tourist, its owner, which despite the name is Hanoi-owned,
has withdrawn these, as it owns the taxis. Seeking out the best Vietnamese
cuisine on the island a taxi did come in useful, however, to get to the
Vietnamese Kitchen at the Six Senses Resort a few kilometres put of town.  
The ‘Vietnam Kitchen’ is open air and you watch as a lady chef from Tay Ninh,
wearing her conical hat, wields her wok and stirs her pan to serve you up
famous Vietnamese dishes. We had ‘banh xeo’, the most crispy golden or country
pancakes I have ever tasted in seventeen years of living in Vietnam. We also
enjoyed a truly exceptional Pho beef noodle soup as well as ‘banh uot’ small
rice cakes with finely minced shrimp.  
I can not finish without praising the Con Dao museum with its exhibits on
wildlife. The history of the islands from prehistoric times and the full grim
story of the era when this was the Vietnamese Devil’s Island. The old museum
housed in the historic Governor’s Palace is now the town’s gallery.

Cay Bang truly is the loveliest of Vietnamese towns. It is well planned, very
clean and there is no hectic hustle and bustle. Whilst very small, it has the
fine cuisine and cultural life of anywhere in the country. Finally, in short
it has everything that is beautiful about a town without dangers or
annoyances. Why not go yourself and enjoy it while it lasts?

_  
 _![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Swimming-pool8-eahorse-resort-

A stream which diverts into a pool by the construction of a weir runs through
the four-star Seahorse Resort and Spa. This, together with four hundred
coconut palms and lawns formed from Thai penny wort, give the Seahorse Resort
and Spa its special characteristics of warmth and charm. Dotted around the 2.6
hectares are the super-comfortable deluxe rooms and suites, bungalows and
villas. A spacious pool, beach and ocean, a spa with a wide range of
treatments and two restaurants-one of which specialises in grilled seafood-
ensured that I and my wifeâ€™s all-too-brief stay left us feeling rejuvenated
and longing to return.  
We stayed in a deluxe garden view bungalow, within a stone’s throw from the
swimming pool and a few steps from the golden strip of beach. A unique feature
was the charming tapestry affixed to the bed head. The scene was of Vietnamese
women wearing conical hats with young children in traditional rural clothing.
I also especially enjoyed sitting out on the veranda with a sea breeze blowing
and relaxing to the sounds of the night. At the time of our stay, the
â€˜Summer Promotionâ€™ was on. For only VND1,899,000 (that is around $90) we
both got accommodation for one night, mocktails, breakfast buffet and a set
lunch. To keep us busy, this price even included a free round of tennis and
use of the sauna thereafter.  
After a substantial breakfast with attentive staff constantly topping up my
cup of American coffee and for the first time in Vietnam enjoying yogurt and
dates at the Hippocampe Restaurant, I sat down by the swimming pool and met Mr
Kha, the general manager. I voiced my fear of coconuts falling on guestsâ€™
heads. â€˜Do not fear, nobody here sings â€œCoconuts Keep Falling on My
Headâ€â€™ he informed me. Then he pointed out the netting underneath all the
bunches. â€˜We have been operating for over ten years and never had an
accident,â€™ he informed me. In fact, I learned that apart from loving their
decorative value, guests at Seahorse can sit by the pool and enjoy a coconut
for a mere VND20,000.  
Still on the subject of food and beverage, we had dinner at the â€˜Seahorse
Bistroâ€™ restaurant. Whilst this is roadside, the traffic at Mui Ne is
minimal compared to Saigon. There was quite a scene of the chefs at a grill
station cooking up seafood. There is display of fresh-as-a- daisy â€˜fruit of
the ocean.â€™ No need to order a set seafood platter; here, you order the
quantity of each item you desire and are charged accordingly. They even have
small lobsters if you just want to sample such an expensive crustacean.  
For our meal we chose oysters, scallops, and king prawns. I wanted to see if
they were good at Western food too, so I ordered a pizza and a Greek salad.
This all came with generous use of the mozzarella cheese on the Hawaiian
pizza. At my Vietnamese wife’s behest, we also had on our plates a delicious
freshwater white-textured fish. Viewed whole at the grill, this was a small
reddish fish. The colour is alluded to in its central Vietnamese name of â€˜Ca
Mong Gaâ€™- in English translation, ‘Cockscomb Fish’. A Google search of its
Southern Vietnamese name of ‘Ca Ba Trau’ revealed it is a kind of gourami, a
fish which is common in Mekong delta waters. This fish is commonly used in the
dish â€˜Canh Chuaâ€™, Vietnamese sour soup. We washed it all down with beer
and mineral water, but the wine cellar at â€˜Seahorseâ€™ is extensive. It
would have to be a bone dry Chardonnay or Rose to go with such superb seafood.  
One further activity I can recommend at Mui Ne is cycling. You will not find
it too tiring, as the terrain is flat and the sea breeze should cool you. The
several kilometres into the actual village of Mui Ne fishing port with its
vibrant market all along the beachfront makes a pleasant ride.  
For now, at least, ‘The Seahorse’ Mui Ne offers superb value for money. It is
a perfect place to unwind by enjoying gardens, pool and beach with the options
of the spa and tennis court and wrapping up your experiences with fine dining.
The friendly staff will treat you like royalty, but you will not pay a king’s
ransom and will have no fear of alarming your bank manager.  
Sometimes selecting a hotel for a place you have never visited before can be a
bit of a gamble. Gambling such as betting on the horses at the Saigon
Racecourse, is of course, a mug’s game. If you were, however, to pick
â€˜Seahorseâ€™ you surely would be onto a winner!

Inside the Cao Dai Complex. Photo: Thu Ba

From the top of a high building in Saigon, if the weather is clear and you
face northwest, visible on the horizon is a lone mountain. Mountains for me
have a magnetic quality. I feel the desire to conquer them; this one
particularly, as it has the mysterious name of the Black Lady Mountain.  
Black Lady Mountain is situated near the town of Tay Ninh. Tay Ninh has two
main tourist draws. Firstly, the mountain itself has a temple complex and
remnants from the â€˜American Warâ€™. Secondly, a tour of Cao Dai Grand Temple
complex makes a trip worthwhile. Most folk would do this on a day tour from
Saigon, perhaps even doing the Cu Chi tunnels on the way out or back. However,
I would recommend taking a more leisurely approach, as we did, by staying at
Hoa Binh hotel for a couple of nights. It is government-run, so do not expect
anyone to leap to carry your bags, but we had a well-appointed VIProom which
came with a balcony and a superb view of the mountain for only 600,000 dongs
per night, including taxes and extras you do not find in Saigon such as bird
songs and fresh air. With its simple Vietnamese rice dishes, I can vouch the
food we tasted here was also clean, good and cheap.  
On the afternoon of our arrival, my son-in-law, Lam, turned up with his
motorbike to take me to the Cao Dai complex. It is large, with dual-lane roads
running through it and occupying eight hectares. Lam was the right person to
go with, as his family are Cao Dai adherents. Housed on this land is a school,
a large garden nursery, part of the original forest conserved as a monkey
sanctuary and a mausoleum to a founder. There are in fact, two temples. The
smaller, often left off the itinerary, is dedicated to the Divine Mother, but
it is beautiful and worth a look at. The â€˜Kingpinâ€™ attraction is the Grand
Temple of the Divine Father.  
Cao Daism, the religion of the era of improved transportation, is syncretic in
nature, drawing on elements of all the world’s great religions. The
architecture of the Grand Temple with apse, nave and columns borrows heavily
from that of a church. Much of the very ornate decoration is oriental,
featuring dragons, snakes, storks and figures in Eastern garb. Some people,
including Graham Greene, have found it Disneyesque, but I disagree. For me it
is colourful, cheerful and aesthetic. Look up to the vaulted ceiling to see a
heaven painted sky-blue with fluffy white clouds and a scattering of stars. In
the lobby, a mural gives a summary of the religion. It is of the three
â€˜signatories of the third alliance between God and Mankindâ€™. They are
author Victor Hugo, Sun Yet Sen and the home-grown prophet Nguyen Binh Nhiem,
writing the Cao Dai mantra of â€˜God and humanity, love and justiceâ€™ in
French and Chinese onto a shining celestial tablet.  
The next day was New Year’s Day and traditionally a day for visiting pagodas.
The Nui Ba Den, or Black Lady Mountain, was packed. All human life was here,
from little old ladies in sandals down to four-year-olds clambering gleefully
up the steps. Though steep in places, the wide staircase with railings goes
all the way up and there are plenty of benches to take a rest. Many tea and
souvenir shops were also open, making for a carnival atmosphere. Proceeding at
a leisurely pace, it took Lam and I just under an hour to reach the Lady of
the Mountain Pagoda and ten minutes more to reach another housed around a
cave.  
We descended via the new cable car. We sat back and enjoyed superb verdant
views of the sugar cane and rice fields, orchards and rubber plantations. To
one side, we could also see the blue of Lake Dau Tieng, which according to
Lam, is Vietnam’s largest. Also, we could something like a bobsleigh run
twisting and turning through the trees. This is the slideway. I would have
loved to have taken that, but it was closed for repairs.  
Once near the base, Lam took me along a path and over a footbridge to a cave,
which had once been occupied by liberation forces. There are realistic mock-
ups of fighters planning a raid, communicating by radio and preparing food. If
you climb all the way to the summit, you can see the remains, including
bunkers and the heliport of the American Camp Ba Den.  
What of the legend of the Black Lady? There appear to be several different
ones. One is of a woman who, upon being attacked by robbers, opted to save her
honour by jumping off a cliff. I have heard that one more than once on my
travels in China. Another Khmer legend has her as a young woman who wished to
devote her life to Buddhism. Rather than obey her father’s command to get
married, she committed suicide on the mountain.  
Back at the in-laws’ house, my wife had returned from a shopping trip. She was
full of praise for the Tay Ninh Market. It is huge, occupying two hectares,
and is privately run. In Mrs de Rouvray’s opinion, it surpasses the Ben Thanh
Market and is, of course, a great deal cheaper.  
On the subject of food, in Tay Ninh Province, closer to Saigon and on the same
road, sits the town of Trang Bang. In this area, you will see many roadside
stalls selling Banh Trang Bang, a double-layer rice paper. The process of
preparing it is complex and involves, among other steps, grilling it over a
peanut shell fire and finally leaving it out overnight to be wetted by the
dew. It can be used as a wrap for a salt and shrimp roll. You might also want
to stop in this town to try a pork noodle soup, which includes the rice paper
along with herbs and is called Banh Canh Trang Bang.  
On our final day in Tay Ninh town, I took a stroll down the 30th of April
Boulevard to the Tay Ninh Provincial Museum. All explanations are in
Vietnamese and it is not a modern museum. Nevertheless, it is interesting and
offers insight into Vietnam’s past at provincial level. Much of it is devoted
to the grim story of the twentieth century, from party and liberation forces
formation to the struggles against the French and the Americans, Tay Ninh
being the end of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The Khmer Rouge incursions into the
province and massacres are also documented. There is a poignant photograph of
scared, captured Khmer female fighters-no more than girls. Also interesting
are artefacts from farming history and reminders of the Cambodian and Oc Eo
civilisations that preceded Vietnamese settlement here. Finally, there are
displays dedicated to four ethic groups that inhabit the province, namely the
Khmer, Cham, Chinese Han and Ta Mun.  
And so, we climbed into our car and said farewell to Tay Ninh, making a vow to
return, perhaps to explore the lake area or to see the province’s remote
National Park. If you have a couple of days, I would urge you to see Tay Ninh
as a mini-destination and not merely as a day trip. It offers a chance to
escape the motorbike rush and see the real Vietnam as well as a glimpse at a
home-grown religion and a romantic mountain.

I was born in Nghe An Province and lived in Hanoi for just four years. But,
whenever I travel, my mind returns to Hanoi.  
Hanoi is of the most ancient cities, the all-time political, cultural, and
social centre of the whole country. It can be affirmed that Hanoi is both the
heart and the pride of Vietnam. At the same time, it was witness to the sacred
resistance wars. Itâ€™s not an overstatement that the victories won by
Hanoiâ€™s people and army in the resistance war against French colonialists
was one of the most decisive attacks in recent memory to crush all dark plots
of the enemies and prove the marvellous power of an indomitable nation.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5512a.jpg)

Moreover, Hanoi is well-known as a beautiful city which features many of the
historical and cultural values of Vietnam. These places have attracted
thousands of visitors yearly, earning a turnover of billions of Vietnam dong.
In the centre of Hanoi is Hoan Kiem Lake â€“ the distinctive symbol of the
capital with a 1,000-year-old civilization. In addition, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum
is the symbol of the strength of intelligence and sacred sentiments that the
Vietnamese people reserved for him. It can be said that the Ho Chi Minh
Mausoleum is both modern and simple, but can manifest all of his decency. In
front of the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is historic Ba Dinh Square, where president
Ho Chi Minh read the declaration of independence, giving birth to the
democratic republic of Vietnam, the first peopleâ€™s democratic country in
Southeast Asia.  
Referring to Hanoi means referring to the Red River. It is said that the Red
River is nearly 1,000 kilometres long. It is recognized as an endless supplier
of alluvia for all the Red River delta areas. Currently, it is one of the most
important waterways in the Northern waterway system. Spanning over the Red
River to the North are the three longest bridges of Vietnam: the Thang Long
Bridge â€“ the symbol of The Vietnam-Soviet friendship, the Long Bien Bridge-
the symbol of French architecture and the Chuong Duong Bridge – the symbol of
Vietnamese architecture and workersâ€™ self-reliant spirit. Recently, two new
bridges have just been completed which are Thanh Tri and Nhat Tan bridges.
Hopefully, these two bridges on will not only embellish the face of Hanoi, but
will also take a deserving part in the socio-economic, transport and
commercial development of the whole country  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5512b.jpg)

Tracing back to the past, we become even prouder of Hanoi and our ancestors.
No sooner had Vietnam liberated Saigon in the Spring 1975, than the Vietnamese
National Assembly held a meeting to reunite the North and South and took the
whole country to socialism. Even so, it had to face countless difficulties.
However, since its foundation, our party has always pursued independent
political policies and lines without depending on any powerful country. It is
the reason why Vietnam in general and Hanoi capital in particular still stand
firm and continue to develop. Not only has Hanoi been registering an
unprecedented development with an ever-growing living standard and high growth
rate, but Hanoi has sought to develop infrastructure on a large scale. The
face of Hanoi is changing for the better with new lives of new types of
people. The atmosphere of Hanoi seems always eventful, from supermarkets with
bustling people to congested crossroads. Moreover, in the process of national
industrialization and urbanization, many slums have been replaced with high-
rise buildings, four-or five-star hotels and supermarkets. So strongly is
Hanoi developing its economy that it lags only behind HCM city in financial
contribution to the state budget.

Development always brings its downsides, of course, but I still love Hanoi so
much. I love every street, every dish and every Hanoi-an. I love the moment
which Hanoi is in the beginning of spring, â€˜SÆ°aâ€™ flowers are as white as
snow in every street corner. At night, street lighting makes Hanoi more
beautiful and colourful; sometimes, the wind blows gently in squalls. In
conclusion, in my heart, Hanoi is always beautiful, simple, and loveable.n

Ban Gioc Falls  
_Photo: Trinh Thu Nguyet_

Itâ€™s one of the best expressions of the gentle power of Mother Nature.
Itâ€™s where oneâ€™s visions and dreams can be born. According to some, itâ€™s
the most beautiful waterfall in Vietnam and one of the top falls of the world.
A tour to Ban Gioc Falls could certainly fulfill oneâ€™s desire for a fresh
and energetic notion of paradise.  
Ban Gioc, or Duc Thien â€“ Ban Uoc Double Falls, as the Chinese call it, is a
cascading fall on Quay Son River on the border between Vietnam and China. It
is significant, not only as a symbol of national sovereignty, but also as an
important destination for Vietnam tourism.

Like a stylish lady, who is beautiful in any of her dresses, Ban Gioc is
attractive in different ways according to the seasons. During the dry season
from October to May, Ban Gioc is elegantly shy, like a goddess whoâ€™s just
descended to earth and is still abashed at worldly scenery. The clear blue
water in summer urges one to take a dip to be one with the sounds and flow.

In rainy season from June to September, however, Ban Gioc is abundant and
formidable. It rumbles and throws up myriads of water particles that form a
misty cloud around it. Seasonal rains may make your way less comfortable, but
having arrived, you will find what you see is worth your while all the same.  
From Hanoi to Ban Gioc, a 370 km distance, you can take a motorbike, a bus or
a car. Each choice has its own advantages. A bike would give you more
flexibility in terms of itinerary. You can stop anywhere you feel like, and
along the way there are so many sights you will want to contemplate and
engrave in your memory. You can also take a bus. The bus fare from My Dinh,
Luong Yen bus terminal to Ban Gioc is between 190 and 210k.  
There are hotels and low-budget inns at Trung Khanh Township and Cao Bang
City, both of which are near to Ban Gioc. The room rate at an inn can range
between 150k and 300k depending on the quality.  
A trip to Ban Gioc offers you the choice to visit some other famous
destinations such as Nguom Ngao cave, Pac Bo cave â€“ Lenin creek, Thang Hem
Lake, etc.  
Pac Bo is a cave in a big lime stone mountain, with a small creek, named Lenin
by Uncle Ho as he was passing near its entrance on a rugged slope. In the dim
light inside the cave, one can see-though not clearly-a line written on the
stone wall, â€˜February the 8th, 1941.â€™ That was the day Ho moved into this
dampened little cave, deep in a gorge and forgotten by God and people. Lenin
is a crystal clear creek, reflecting the blue of the skies and the lush
meditative green of the surrounding forests.  
Nguom Ngao Cave is about 3 km from Ban Gioc, the gut of a mountain in Trung
Khanh District of Cao Bang. Its total length is 2144m, with 3 main entrances,
Nguom Ngao, Nguom Lom and Ban Thuon. Deep inside, it has stalactites and
stalagmites of all shapes and sizes that can ignite even the weakest
imagination, and a gurgling creek that makes it surreal and one of a kind.  
Lake Thang Hen is a fresh water lake in Quoc Toan Commune, Tra Linh District,
Cao Bang Province. In Tay language the name means â€˜bee bellyâ€™, because
seen from above, it has the shape of a beeâ€™s belly. The lake and the scenery
around it have inspired a legend that is told to those who visit it.

**The scenic lake Thang Hen**  
Cao Bang also has many historical sites that you can visit. They tell the
contributions of the land and the people of Cao Bang to the cause of the
nation, contributions that resonate in the visitorsâ€™ heart.  
Cao Bang is a frontier of our country. So to avoid possible problems one
should bring all the necessary personal papers. A first aid kit would help in
case you get scratched while hiking the mountains and forests. A light jacket
can shield you from the heat of mid-day son and the chill of the evenings.  
Come to Cao Bang and Ban Gioc falls where you will feel as though you are
seeing paradise right in front of you. You will see that it is irresistible,
even to the most hardened hearts. Hit the road now!

Chambre Rouge (The Red Room) of Jean Pierre Berckmans in 1973. Walking along
the hotelâ€™s corridors of bowed faÃ§ade, long horizontal lines and nautical
porthole windows, you may hear whispered the tales of a bygone era.

**Pip de Rouvray rings out the old  
and brings in the new at Sofitel Saigon Plaza**

On coming to the end of a year, it is time to start thinking of what new and
different things one can do in the new year. The Sofitel Plaza Hotel in
H.C.M.C. is never one to rest on its laurels and is always ready to sail into
uncharted waters. I went along to this great temple of Franco-Vietnamese taste
to chat with the culinary wizard that the hotel acquired in 2016, Chef Marko
Rankel, and to get a preview of the special menu he has created for New
Yearâ€™s Eve. Actually, the menu premiered on December 1 and will run
throughout January. Also, as Marko explained, it is not his creation, but a
corroborative work with his team. His method is to simply put forward his
general vision of the dishes and then get creative input from his colleagues.
He says he generally gets a result of around eighty per cent of what he
originally envisages.  
The Saigon Plaza is a fine place to extend your knowledge of the French
language. Have any of you ever heard of an â€˜amuse boucheâ€™? It is basically
what the Spanish call a â€˜tapaâ€™, something to chomp on while waiting for
the first platter to come. Marko informed me that in some parts of France it
is known as an â€˜amuse gueuleâ€™ which somewhat shocked me as I was taught
that gueule was coarse language; equivalent maybe to â€˜gobâ€™ in English.
Anyhow, three small pieces of finger food arrived with a palette of three
different coloured sauces to dip them in, along with a basket of assorted
breads.  
Each course came in the nouvelle cuisine style, colourful and complete with
sauce and balsamic reduction squiggles and framed by a large square plate. All
ingredients are flown in from France except for the vegetables. First came a
combined terrine of duck and goose with winter truffle jelly, smoked pear and
almond salad.  
Now the meal gained some liquidity as we were served a dish with contrasting
hot and cold elements, which was the lobster bouillabaisse with oyster tartar,
grilled eel and lemon foamâ€”an amazing combination which only a highly
creative mind could compose. Following this, a sweet note was added to the
culinary symphony with an orange sorbet. Then it was back to the scrumptious
savoury tastes as we tucked into scampi and scallops poached in saffron with
truffle and a ricotta cheese-stuffed Chinese dumpling; a fine imaginative
example of an Asian European fusion creation.  
The adventure continued with something new for me â€” Wagyu beef. Those cows
thought they had it made in life with all those massages and free beer! Little
did they know there is no such thing as a free beer, I mused as I had a piece
of one for lunch. Such amazing texture and taste. The aftertaste lingered on
my palate until well into the afternoon. It came marinated in truffle fondue
with green and white asparagus, warm olives and tomato salad and mushrooms.  
All this was rounded off by a golden vertical tube of golden chocolate
tapering at the top. It came accompanied by a trilogy of apple-based
creations. The chocolate on its own reminded of Saigonâ€™s iconic Bitexco
tower minus the heliport platform.  
Mention can be made here too of other treats to be tempted by at the Sofitel.
The ever-popular buffet restaurant The Mezz will be introducing a once-a-week
Seafood Buffet early in the new year. The Boudoir lounge is always an ideal
place to enjoy afternoon light eats or an early evening cocktail. Another tip
is that the Christmas hampers will also be available for the Sino-Vietnamese
New Year and make excellent gifts for Vietnamese friends and business
associates.  
All in all, this innovative menu served in an elegant restaurant with a warm
and comfortable decor in the company of dear friends and family would be a
great way to say goodbye to 2016 or to welcome in 2017. Furthermore, I advise
you to be â€˜toujours a la vedette!â€™ or in plain English, to keep an eye out
on the Boulevard Le Duan for more exciting surprises throughout the New Year.
There is an ancient proverb which runs, â€˜Out of Africa there is always
something newâ€™. This little dictum equally applies to the â€˜Sofitel Plaza
Saigonâ€™.

**The New Yearâ€™s Eve set course menu  
is priced at VND 1,850,000 for a six course menu/wine pairing  
VND 1,100,000 per person 31 December 2016 from 7 p.m.

A cruise on Ngo Dong River leading to Tam Coc – Bich Dong, Ninh Binh Province.  
_Photo: Dinh Huu Ngot  
_

â€˜Spending over a week wandering tortuous paths of the northwest mountains, I
thought I had seen all the mind-blowing beauty of Vietnamese paddies. And yet,
I was astonished again at the sight of successive limestone lining up on an
endless rice field. A thousand years ago, this place was the capital of three
dynasties that have left marks on the face of the earth.â€™  
That is the impression of Ewen Bel, a British news reporter, about the rice
fields in the 350ha Tam Coc â€“ Bich Dong tourist zone of Ninh Binh Province.
The fields are located at the heart of the 12,000 ha Trang An conglomerate of
famous landscapes, a â€˜worldâ€™s cultural and natural heritage siteâ€™.  
Besides sculpture like rocks standing on a plain field, and resembling Ha Long
Bay, a Worldâ€™s Wonder of Nature, the Tam Coc â€“ Bich Dong tourist zone also
has many historical vestiges related to the Vu Lam royal step-over site of the
Tran Dynasty almost 800 years ago.  
This area is located just 2km from 1A national highway, 7km from Ninh Binh and
9km from Tam Diep, which are about 100-110 km from Hanoi.  
According to the Tam Coc â€“ Bich Dong tourist zone management, it is
connected to the Trang An Worldâ€™s Cultural and Natural Heritage
Conglomeration by nearly 20 touristsâ€™ routes for bikes, woven bamboo boats
or by hiking.  
Worthy of the name â€˜Ha Long Bay on landâ€™, Tam Coc â€“ Bich Dong is scenic,
poetic and deeply miraculous at all times and in all weather. But it is the
most fabulous during the harvest season from late May to mid- June.  
From 8-9 am, with a ticket bought at Dinh Cac landing, you are seated in a
local traditional woven bamboo boat. The boat leisurely carries you along the
Ngo Dong River, endlessly meandering amidst a boundless field of ripening rice
and sculpture like high rocks which tower above everything.  
Cool breezes make the rice ripple and you feel as if you are cruising in a Ha
Long Bay where seawater has turned golden. Every now and then, you come close
to sheer rock faces and enigmatic-looking caverns.  
After about 45 minutes, you arrive at Tam Coc landing in order to visit Thai
Vi Temple, to see how inseparable history and nature can be. Built in 1258,
Thai Vi Temple is dedicated to the heroes that were stationed at the Vu Lam
military base; Kings Tran Thai Tong, Tran Nhan Tong and their top military
leaders Tran Hung Dao, and Tran Quang Khai.  
Tam Coc means three caves because it has First Cave, Second Cave and Third
Cave. Leaving Thai Vi Temple, you hike a short distance to see the caves,
which are all carved out by the water of Ngo Dong River over millennia. 127m
long, First Cave, with a 20m wide entrance and a lot of stalagmites, pierces a
big rock. About 1km away, the 60m long Second Cave exhibits milky stalactites.
Nearby, the Third Cave is only 50m long, with a lower ceiling.  
After having local delicacies at lunch in Tam Coc Restaurant, you get moving
again to get to Bich Dong, just 2km away. The name Bich Dong, given by the
Royal Executive Nguyen Nghiem, father of the great poet Nguyen Du in 1773,
means â€˜Blue Caveâ€™. In the old time, people said that Blue Cave was the
second most beautiful place in the country.  
The Bich Dong area includes a small cave halfway up a mountain, three pagodas
built in the era of Late Le Dynasty (1427-1789), and most notably, a creek
running in a cave through a mountain base, thus called Xuyen Thuy Dong (Water
Pierced Cave).  
Xuyen Thuy Dong is like a half-pipe, 350m long, zigzagging through from the
East Side to the West Side of Bich Dong Mount. The pipe is 6m in diameter on
average, and 15m in the widest place. The walls are quite smooth, and the
ceiling is beautifully curved and decorated with rocks of different shapes.

It often rains suddenly in the afternoon at Tam Coc- Bich Dong, so donâ€™t
forget to bring a raincoat or an umbrella.  
**Ticket price:** VND120,000 for adults, and VND60,000 for children below 1.4m  
 **Boat hire:** VND150,000 for a two-seat boat.

**Visitors can get to the park from Hue, Da Nang or Lang Co. Bach Ma Park is
situated just 4km off National Highway No 1 in Phu Loc District. It is 40km
south of Hue and 60km away from Da Nang.  
Bicycles, motorcycles, vans or local buses are all convenient to reach the
parkâ€™s entrance gate. Public buses operate from Da Nang to Hue every 15
minutes with a ticket price of VND60,000 per passenger. Visitors can also rent
motorcycles from Da Nang, Hue or Lang Co.  
**

Bach Ma is the only one of the five â€˜siblingâ€™ locations discovered and
developed into a vacation land by the French, along with Sapa, Tam Dao, Ba Na
and Da Lat, that has retained its almost pristine nature.  
With its peak sitting at 1,450 metres above sea level, Bach Ma Mountain is the
most ideal place in the country to enjoy mild weather. The mountain also
boasts significant biodiversity.

**Perfect biodiversity and nature conserve  
** Bach Ma National Park was formed in 1991. The park has a total area of
nearly 37,500ha and is home to more than 4,500 flora and fauna species,
including endemic and endangered species listed by International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  
Some endangered primates, including black-shanked douc, loris, and gibbons,
have appeared in high frequency in the areas with visitors to the park.  
It is a living place for two of the world’s rarest mammals â€“ Asian biocorn
and Vu Quang ox. Conservationists also found the pheasant species of lophura
edwardsi, an endemic bird.  
According to the park authorities, its rich biodiversity also shelter several
deer species, including Truong Son, as well as evergreen flora.  
The park rangers have worked hard for decades to reduce impacts from
outsiders. The old practices of farming, illegal logging and hunting by locals
are the common threats to the parkâ€™s nature.

**Idyllic place for trekking**  
The park was discovered by the French engineer Girard in 1925. Later, the
French developed a total of 139 villas to turn the mountain into a health
resort centre, where visitors could enjoy the average temperature of between
15 and 20 degrees Celsius in summer and 5 degrees Celsius in winter.  
Visitors have several options of ecofriendly tour programmes to enjoy nature
in the park. According to the park authorities, the tours are designed in a
positive manner to ensure the best protection of nature from the negative
impact of 15,000 tourists visiting the park annually.  
Accommodations in the park are supplied mainly by eight villas built by the
French nearly 100 years ago. The park offers visitors six trekking tour
programmes, departing from the accommodation centre, including trip to Tri Sao
to Do Quyen Waterfall, to the mountain peak, where visitors stand in Hai Vong
Dai to have a look to the sea, and to Ngu Ho, where five lakes lie together.  
At the park, visitors also have chance to go deeper into the world of birds if
they employ the service of guide Truong Cam, who is able to lure hundreds of
birds into the trees around him by whistling.  
According to the park authorities, hotel service in the villas can host 100
tourists at a time. Chefs are available to offer local food and wild
vegetables at the villas as well as for night parties at camp fire site on the
mountain peak.

**Officials debate merits of upgrading Bach Ma  
** Local authorities in Thua Thien Hue recently proposed to take 387ha from
the core zone of Bach Ma park to develop a tourism complex, which would
include cable car systems. Experts fear that the proposed cable car systems
would destroy its biodiversity as well as the natural beauty of the jungle and
mountain.  
According to local authorities, the systems would have two routes. One route
links the reception hall at the parkâ€™s entrance gate and the mountain peak;
another connects the peak with Ngu Ho, where five lakes sit at one site.  
The cable car project advisor is POMA Group, a ropeway transportation firm
headquartered in France. POMAâ€™s representatives told audiences at a seminar
held to introduce the complex proposal that the system would not create
pollution in terms of noise or emissions. However, experts estimated that the
two cable car routes, one 4km long and another 1.6km long, would take up about
15ha of forest land, which is a great deal of the habitat space for flora and
sauna in the park, creating obvious harm to the parkâ€™s biodiversity.  
The 15ha land area claimed by the system accounted for the 26m width
protection corridors along the lines, in which 5.6km line would take 145,600
square metres or 14.6ha. Several experts recommended discarding the cable car
plan while others said the second route, which connects the mountain peak and
Ngu Ho, should not be built.  
â€œDefinitely, the cable car system should not be built,â€ said Dang Dinh Sy,
an operator of a tour expedition for exploring nature in Bach Ma. Sy said that
the road running from the mountain foot to its peak is good enough for
transportation.  
Sy said the tourism planners should obtain a wider view of tourism in the
central region as well as the nationwide. He added that there are lots of
choices for those visitors wanting to use cable car services in the area
around Bach Ma, including at Tam Dao, Da Lat and Ba Na.  
â€œTrendy visitors to Bach Ma are those who want hiking, trekking, bird
viewing and flora and sauna exploring. Some others come to perform Zen
meditation and yoga,â€ he said.  
â€œVisitors choose to come there to trek, to enjoy the nature in a typical
biosphere as well as to soak in the magic light of sunrise and sunset at the
height of 1,400m above the sea level. But definitely not to stay in modern
hotel facilities,â€ he said.

**Measures to improve current service in Bach Ma  
** Travel agents that offer tours frequently into Bach Ma said the park does
not need the new buildings that could harm the pristine nature of the place,
but the improvement of service as well as full use of the 139 existing nearby
villas.  
Due to wetness in the mountain, hotel rooms in the park are said to be humid.
Many visitors said the rooms need to be drier and cleaner. They also wanted
more soap at the public restrooms around the park. People in love with the
park suggested more warning signs to prevent Vietnamese visitors from dumping
waste as well as making use of the wild to perform their superstitious
rituals.  
According to experts and those familiar to Bach Ma, local tourism authorities
need to make full use of the existing villas in the park. Some said the
tourism sector should work harder to lure qualified investors, expecting
strong investment could help revive the villas as well as add more service to
the existing infrastructure.  
The majority of people know of Bach Ma supported the conserve this natural
pearl while continuing to lure tourists.

**_One of the Xin Man Rocks_  
  
 **Vietnam Heritage, March 2011 —** There is a group of inscribed rocks called
‘Xin Man Rocks’ (Đá Xín Mần, in Vietnamese, but probably from a local
language), in Nung Ma Lu Village, Nam Dan Commune, Xin Man District, in the
far northeastern province of Ha Giang, that Vietnam’s Institute of Archaeology
says were inscribed about 2,000 years ago.  
The inscriptions are on nine large rocks and include representations of human
figures, feet and reproductive organs, circles and terraced rice fields.  
Also, pieces of rock were broken off.  
The Xin Man Rocks were discovered in 2005 and recognized by the Vietnamese
Government as National Archaeological Relics in 2008.  
They are deep in a valley below where Nam Dan Spring and terraced rice paddies
wind around a mountain and small stilt houses, half-hidden in clouds, sit on
the mountainside. The houses are the centre of Nam Dan Commune, bordering
China.  
The people are of five ethnicities: Nung, Hmong, Chinese, Kinh and Tay. The
Nung make up most of the population, with 2,724 people in 470 households. The
commune consists of 12 villages, ten entirely Nung.  
The Nung, who have been living there the longest, believe the universe is made
up of three parts: a holy fairy world, a world for human beings and an
underground. Their pantheon includes their ancestors, a kitchen god, forest
god, spring (water source) god and rock god.  
Nam Dan (Nấm Dẩn), where the inscribed rocks are, is the only commune among a
number in the area that worships a rock god. On the second day of the sixth
lunar month, people set up an altar at the inscribed rocks to worship the rock
god.

A short while ago, I was asked if the Vietnamese fondness for eating snails
were a consequence of the former French presence here. Well I can tell you
there is firm archaeological evidence that people in Vietnam have been chowing
down on molluscs since neolithic times. In Europe , written records tell us
that there was such high demand for the delicacy during the Roman Empire that
they were even farmed.  
The big difference in gastronomy here is that Europeans eat land snails,
whereas in this watery land the snails are dug out of rivers, ponds, lakes and
muddy shorelines and estuaries. As much as the English do the
Vietnamese,including my wife,turn their noses up at the thought of eating ‘Oc
Sen’- land snail. A notable exception here is from my son in law’s home town
of Tay Ninh where the locals love their mountain snails.  
Between Europe and Vietnam there is also a sociological difference in the
eating of snail. In France they are associated with high end dining and they
are often served with their rear ends stuffed with garlic butter. In contrast,
the best place to eat snails in Vietnam can be in a quite down to earth ‘Quan
Oc’ Here you will find a wide selection of the more common varieties and
mainly men quaffing down beer as they eat. I had originally intended to write
this article about a visit to one such place which gets five star reviews on
the ‘Trip Advisor’ website. However on reconnoitre I discovered it is a small
shop-like affair on a narrow busy street with more then the usual Saigon noise
and pollution-unsuitable for a family night out.  
So oft we went to try out a seafood restaurant located on a street where I
work; namely the Ran Bien 7 (Sea Shrimp 7), which has snails high on the bill
of fare. As the number would imply, this one of a chain with branches dotted
around town. Our party consisted of myself, my wife, our two daughters with
the elder one husband and our two grand daughters.  
The restaurant is housed in a voluminous hall open to the street at one end.
There is a grill station fired by charcoal timber and a white board with the
price of the dishes posted. But the main attraction was the highly oxygenated
aquaria centrally placed where we adults could introduce ourselves to our
dinner and where the children could gaze in wonderment at such exotica as
menacing Canadian King Crab,very ugly looking stone fish or , as they name
them in Vietnamese, ca mat quy (evil eye fish) gigantic lobster and prawn and
outsized grouper fish.  
From the half a dozen or so snail dishes on the menu we ordered the Oc Huong
(babylonia areolata), or in English, Perfume Snail so named from its fragrance
both when fresh and cooked. It had the crunchiness and taste of sweet whelks.
We also tried the Oc Mong Tay (Fingernail Snails) which were much larger and
elongated. Not really a snail but a clam was the plate of So Duong Artex. All
were served steamed and presented in their shells with garnishings of onion
greens and peanuts-all very scrumptious and fresh.  
Other dishes ordered by the party were blue swimmer crab,seafood rice mainly
for the children ,and a seafood hotpot with rice noodles. Washed down with
copious amounts of Saigon Export beer this was all a rare treat. I will add
there are some very expensive imported items on offer such as lobsters at
several million dongs a piece and both from Canada king crab and geoduck. The
latter is very long and phallic looking Pacific Ocean clam-the translation of
this name which is from a native Canadian language says as much.  
Overall, we all had a very enjoyable evening. My Vietnamese wife gave the Ran
Bien ten out of ten for everything but price. She was a bit shocked the bill
came in at 2,800,000 VND. But for five adults and two kiddies if you are from
London, Paris or New York you probably would not bat an eyelid. Finally those
of you have still have a prejudice about eating snails, is it not about time
you came out of your shells and tasted their delights? Neither you nor your
stomach will be disappointed.

Todayâ€™s Phu Tho Province  
was the land chosen by Hung Kings, the first rulers of Vietnam, to be their  
capital. Considered the cradle of the Viet people, this area still preserves  
the temples of Hung Kings and many other historical relics such as pagodas and
shrines.

A midland area lying  
between mountains and lowland planes, the Phu Tho landscape is imposing,  
commanding, and poetic at the same time. The lush rolling tea hills are a  
perfect example of that.

Phu Tho is currently  
one of the provinces with the largest tea plantation areas in the country. The  
tea trees not only benefit thousands of households but also create enchanting  
beauty for the land of Phu Tho.

The tea hill of Long  
Coc, Tan Son District is one of the most typical, most beautiful tea hills of  
Phu Tho. From this vantage point, one can see a countless number of green tea  
hills teeming all around, each looking like a coiled dragon.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/134B-Bo%202-PC17-06p.jpg)

Mother Nature has blessed  
this land with the soil and weather best suitable for growing tea, and tea has  
been growing here for ages. The all-green beauty of these winding hills  
inevitably fascinates all who have ever been to these 600ha tea plantations.
Rows  
of tea plants soften the form of the hills. The typical dark green color of
tea  
leaves, shining and lush, which remains the same all year round, makes it feel  
so calm, so peaceful, yet so endearing.

It is best to view the  
Long Coc tea hill early in the morning, when one can feel the harmony  
between nature  
and humans, when timid rays of the sun try to penetrate silky layers of the
morning  
mist. Thatâ€™s when ladies and young girls start to come up these hills and
their  
hands begin the magic dance among the tea buds still heavy with dewdrops.

The scenic charm of  
the tea hills, the happy hard-working life, full of positive optimism and the  
tea culture of the people of Phu Tho makes it an interesting and attractive  
destination for many genres of tourism.

In  
April, the last fiery flowers of the cotton trees spark on mountain slopes.  
With the long-brewing desire inside to conquer the scenic tourist path from
Bac  
Ha (Lao Cai) to Xin Man, the most desolate highland district of Ha Giang
Province,  
we hit the road on a beautiful weekend.

From Bac Ha township, the winding road  
up the Lung Phinh slope to the Lung Cai â€“ Ban Gia fork is very smooth, lined  
with newly planted corn fields that began rooting and springing tender buds
and  
terrace fields waiting for the first rain showers to begin new crops. Some  
milpas previously used to grow soya are now growing pharmaceuticals in order
to  
make more income for local farmers. Looking from above down at the rows of  
ashweed and artichoke covered with nylon sheets, one realizes how well the  
highland farmers are catching up with new technologies.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/-Gy%20la%20cung%20=%C2%B2_ng%20=%C2%B2_c%20r_t%20nhi_u%20cua-r\)%20ch_n%20lam%20=%C2%B2_ng%20=ua%20l_%20t%C2%B2_ngp.jpg)

Having  
passed Lung Cai, we come to the frontier area, which begins with Nan Ma
Commune,  
where it is rumored among trampers the valley is fantastic during the season
of  
ripening rice. Although coming not at the time this natural scene is
exhibited,  
we had nevertheless a very specific feeling one always has when coming for the  
first time to a new land. We passed the center of the commune with a school,
an  
administrative center and houses on the roadsides, just like the other Bac Ha  
and Si Ma Cai highland communes of Lao Cai. Nan Ma folks told us that this  
national tourist destination witnessed the heroic death of 11 military  
entertainers during the war of resistance. The place also boasts the Cave of  
Fairies where one can pray for good health.

It was summer but the weather felt like  
that of autumn, making the journey so much more pleasurable amidst the  
imposing, majestic highlands. We were especially impressed by the rocky  
mountains and the paddy fields full of big and small rocks scattered all  
around. Here and there, rocks stack up like massive quires of stone papers.  
Sometimes we encounter Xin Man villagers working the rocky land before sowing  
the seeds, an image we have previously seen only on TV. Forest flowers bloom  
timidly on the slopes. A rare coral tree covered in brightly red flowers stood  
out like a landmark in the serenity of the mountains.

  
From the top of the slope in Nan Ma, we  
looked down at the multiple coils of the road deep in the gorge, knowing
thatâ€™s  
the path we would take to get to Coc Pai. The view before us was breathtaking.  
We went under lush pine groves that whistled in the wind. The town of Coc Pai  
sunk deep at the bottom of the gorge at the end of the coils of the road.  
Someone in our group was so moved by the scenery as to utter a few verses  
lauding the beauty of the fatherland. At Coc Pai, the center of the Xin Man
District,  
we asked about the way to proceed. From hearsay, from the 0km post of Coc Pai  
township, one has to go 25km to get to the Xin Man frontier bazaar or to the  
Fairy waterfall, and 145km to reach the chief town of the Ha Giang Province.  
But some folks in Coc Pai say that it will be possible to get up to the Fairy  
waterfall only in May-June.

Perhaps  
because there are now outstanding professional services like in other famous  
tourist destinations, here at Xin Man, instead of fuss and crowds, we felt
very  
quiet, very private, very relaxed, completely freed from the mundane haste.  
Many foreign tourists like to come here just to walk around in the village and  
share the everyday life with the local ethnic minorities of Hâ€™Mon, Cao Lan,  
Nung, Yao, La Chi, Phu La, Tay etc. on these rocky mountains. Thatâ€™s why the  
stretch of road between Bac Ha â€“ Xin Man is so suitable for the tourists who  
want to explore and experience the eternal calm, the poetic and majestic  
scenery, the simple life and unique culture of the local highlanders.

On  
the tourist map of Ha Giang Province, Xin Man is marked as an attractive  
destination with locations planned by the district government to be developed  
into typical tourist packages to attract visitors to this rocky plateau. From  
the words of a Coc Pai town resident as we took a rest, tourists coming to Xin  
Man can visit Fairy Waterfall, Windy Pass, the ancient rock field in Nam Zan
Gorge  
at the headwaters of Chay River, and hot spring at Nam Choong (Quang Nguyen
Commune.)  
They can also enjoy foods and drinks of the local ethnic minorities and learn  
about the unique features of their culture, as well as legends about places  
that have secrets yet to be deciphered.

Winding roads, rocky mountains, rumbling  
waterfalls, scenic terrace fields, and friendly, hospitable people were enough  
to give us a day as happy as could be while we experienced the beautiful tour  
in the Northwest full of interesting novelties. We vow to come back in the  
season of ripening rice and buckwheat blossom.

**Lung Cu Peak  
of Dragon Mountain, rises 1470m above sea level and belongs to Lung Cu
Commune,  
Dong Van District, Ha Giang Province. Sharing a border with China, this  
mountain has witnessed the long history of the Vietnamese fighting against  
foreign aggressors. That is why Lung Cu is considered a sacred place of the  
Vietnamese people.**

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/130B-Bo%203-PC17-LungCu2p.jpg)

Historical records say  
that the generalissimo Ly Thuong Kiet (1019-1105) once set his flag on Lung
Cu.  
Since then, kings and military leaders of Vietnam have always had their eyes
on  
Lung Cu. Vietnamese flags are often seen flying proudly on a high pole over
the  
peak.

The more  
robust Lung Cu flag post was built in 2002. It has an octagonal stem similar
to  
the flag post of Hanoi, but smaller and only 20m high. The octagonal base or  
pedestal is decorated with eight reliefs illustrating the historical periods
of  
Vietnam and the customs of the Ha Giang people. The 9m long and 6m wide  
Vietnamese flag soars majestically on top of a high pole. The 54m2  
area of the flag represents 54 ethnicities living in the territory of Vietnam.

Seen  
from below, the wind-filled red flag emblazoned with a golden star in its
center  
seems to be elevating the flag-post and the solemn mountain beneath it.

To reach  
the Lung Cu flag post, visitors must climb 700 stone stairs. The view changes  
with every step, becoming more and more breathtaking, and so do the feelings,
as  
one gets higher and higher. At the top,visitors can contemplate a panoramic  
view of rolling hills and hamlets of ethnic minorities scattered on the
slopes.

To see even more from a higher point,  
visitors can climb the spiral staircase inside the flag-post. After 140 more
steps,  
one comes out to an open court which seems to be floating in the heavens.

As a  
historical vestige related to millennia of border defense, surrounded by  
natural grandeur, Lung Cu flag post in recent years has attracted tourists
from  
far and wide.

_The Lung Cu flag post is  
about 200km from Ha Giang Township. Starting from Ha Giang Township, following  
the national highway 4C eastward for about 160km, one comes to Dong Van
Commune  
of Dong Van District. From here, follow the asphalt road for about 40km to
Lung  
Cu Peak. There are many buses taking this route._

About 200km from Hanoi, Moc Chau is a vast plateau, considered by many to be
the most beautiful of the Northern highlands. So beautiful is it that many
visitors have dubbed it â€œthe paradise on earth.â€ Perhaps itâ€™s the
permanent presence of blurring mist and fluffy clouds that makes Moc Chau so
mesmerizing.  
No visitor can escape the hypnotic power of the scene of rolling hills,
forests, valleys and hamlets of ethnic minorities blurred in the mist or now
disappearing now appearing from behind the clouds. The mist makes tea
plantations and grazing grounds look as soft as silk. The clouds now hang
around leisurely, now fill up the whole universe just to be dispersed a moment
later by the winds. A tourist described it in on his Facebook page â€œsurreal
and otherworldly.â€  
The glamour of Moc Chau mist and clouds is also reflected in the words of a
photographer who shared his experiences. The best place to take good pictures
is at the highest vantage points looking down at other heaving rocky peaks.
Then one has to wait for the moment when sun rays penetrate the clouds and
gold plates the hill slopes.  
Tan Lap Commune, about 10km from Moc Chau township, has the most beautiful
tea-covered hills of Moc Chau, among which the best ones are named Heart,
Heart 2 and Heart 3. Here visitors can contemplate tea plantations that form
the heart shape and at the same time learn the way our ethnic minorities
collect and process tea.  
Na Ka Valley, about 16km from Moc Chau township, has the most beautiful plum
plantation in the region. This area is called â€œthe fairylandâ€, especially
in the springtime when plum trees blossom. The valley is covered in an
exquisite white velvet dress that flutter in the breeze.  
Pa Phach, or Ba Phach, a hamlet by National Highway 6, about 5km from Moc Chau
township, is a habitat of Thai and Hâ€™Mong people. It is called the
â€œparadise of crucifer flowers.â€ During the blossoming season from Nov to
late Dec the whole area is blanketed in white, so pure that it is almost
divine.  
Pha Luong Peak, almost 2000m above sea level near 23 the Laos border, also
called Bo Lung (meaning Big Mountain), is the â€œRooftop of Moc Chau.â€ The
majestic and solemn mountain revered by the local ethnic minorities is about
35km from the township of Moc Chau, through many places, perilous but no less
scenic than other peaks.

**At 1050m above sea level, Moc Chau plateau is part of Moc Chau District, Son
La ­­­Province. The climate is temperate. The area is culturally diverse
because it is home to more than 10 ethnic groups.  
 _From My Dinh bus terminal in Hanoi from 9am to 10pm there are many buses to
Moc Chau township.  
Ticket price is around 150,000VND/person. One can also hire a motorbike at the
hotel to go to Moc Chau. At the town of Moc Chau there are many inns and
hotels. Prices range between 200,000 â€“ 1,000,000VND/room/night.

In early 2019, Na Hang â€“ Lam Binh Nature Reserve in Tuyen Quang Province was
recognized as a â€œNational Special Scenic Attraction.â€ Located in Na Hang
and Lam Binh districts, 250km from Hanoi, this 40,000ha attraction has
33,061ha of forests and 8,000ha of lakes.  
Multiple lakes densely surrounding karsts help diversify wildlife in the Na
Hang â€“ Lam Binh forests with 1,162 floral species and 430 fauna species,
including black snub-nosed monkeys, which can be found only in Vietnam.  
Scientists have also found in the caves within the Na Hang â€“ Lam Binh
forests traces of prehistoric people. During the recent historical period,
many of the caves within the reserve were used as military camps, offices and
weapon production factories of the Vietnamese army in the wars against the
French and Americans.  
Today, about 15 ethnic minorities live in the forests of Na Hang â€“ Lam Binh
with their unique culture, making it a diverse cultural environment.  
With the above mentioned natural, historical and cultural characteristics the
Na Hang â€“ Lam Binh Nature Reserve has many secrets waiting for visitors to
uncover.  
According to the authorities of Tuyen Quang Province, the nature reserve has
52 spots for tourists to visit, including 32 scenic places, seven
archaeological relics, nine vestiges of architecture and arts, and four
cultural heritage sites. A dozen of these spots have been ranked national
attractions or relics.  
**  
The most notable spots  
** 99 Thuong Lam peaks in Thuong Lam Commune of Lam Binh District is one of
the most beautiful places in the reserve, about 15km from the Lam Binh
District township. The 99 peaks are not only picturesque, but also related to
a mythological legend.  
Song Long Cave of Khuon Ha Commune of Lam Binh District is bigger and more
beautiful among the caves of the reserve. The 200m- long cave is about 50m
wide with the ceiling 40m high, full of mysterious-looking and magnificent
stalactites that look like chandeliers.  
Phia Muon Cave, an archaeological relic in Son Phu Commune is about 7km from
Na Hang township. This is the dwelling space and graveyard of prehistoric
people. In this cave, scientists found sophisticated stone tools and graves
dated 3500 â€“ 4500 years ago. Visitors to Phia Muon cave will see dozens of
such graves of the post-Neolithic times and the dwelling of people of that
ancient era.  
Age-old villages of the Tay people such as those of Dong Da, Ban Khe, Bang
Giong, Na Ta etc. are purely Tay villages where Tay people maintain their
ancient lifestyle, customs and culture. Each village is a group of ancient
stilted houses standing at a foothill near terraced paddy fields, creating a
peaceful and poetic scenery. People live by growing rice, domestic animals,
and weaving traditional brocades. To many, the image of Tay women in
traditional garments sitting by an old loom is a symbol of this land.

Downtown East is a special thing. As a business run by the National Trades
Union Congress, it can exist and be successful only in Singapore. It was
certainly the first time I have seen such a thing in my life, and it will
remain unique, for a long time. It is a vibrant, purely Singaporean
phenomenon.  
The evening of Nov 10, 2018 masses of people gathered to celebrate its 30th
anniversary. Ng Chee Meng, NTUC Club Chairman and NTUC Secretary-General
projected what it will be like in 30 years , embracing technology revolution
as an opportunity, not a threat.  
Because Downtown Eastâ€™s main purpose is to serve the working folks of
Singapore, it is hardly known outside of that country. There is hardly a
Chinese or Indian, or Vietnamese or Indonesian etc. who knows about Downtown
East. Neither did I.  
Located in the middle of Pasir Ris Street, the very green Downtown East is
surrounded by 10-15 storey blocks of low-cost residential housing of a large
Eastern area of Singapore, where local working people can buy a housing unit
and have to pay only 40% of the cost, the other 60% covered by the government.
The first impression Downtown East makes is that it is very spacious. Of
course, it has to be so in order to host working masses in special occasions.  
Secondly, it has everything a person needs. So, anyone that has some money can
live in the compound all year round without going out. Downtown East has a
resort called D-resort; a water park called Wild Wild Wet; an enhanced retail,
dining and entertainment mix at Market Square that includes a kind of food
court with a lot of tidy, small restaurants, a row of shops where one can buy
almost everything a tenant may need, a modern child care center and even a
bowling alley; and a high-capacity MICE facility for corporate and consumer
events known as MUCE. All the foods and goods sold here are of good quality at
very reasonable prices. In fact, there are people who make it home here for
long periods of time. During my stay at D-resort, many BBQ parties were going
on around all day. The resort management explained to me that people could
book a place and bring their stuff to the resort ground to have a good time.  
In addition, two years ago the Singaporean government invested 200 million
dollars to renovate the facility.The D-resort part looks like a village with
large communal houses surrounded by stilted houses, all connected by roofed
walk paths. The newly built rooms are beautiful, comfortable and of top
quality. Room service is friendly yet discreet. Singaporeans seem to use the
resort as their own country retreat house.  
The investment was also used to expand the Wild Wild Wet water park with new
exciting rides: Royal Flush, Free Fall, Vortex – Singaporeâ€™s first high-
speed 360Â° loops ride and Kraken Racers – Singaporeâ€™s first four-lane mat
racer slide. Furthermore a Kid-zone and Cabana service have also opened
recently. D-resort and Wild Wild Wet combined became Singaporeâ€™s first
Integrated Water Park Resort. Again, as I observe them, Singaporeans seem to
have fun in the water park as if it is in their own back yard.  
I wonâ€™t be surprised if told that Downtown East is not only great but also
profitable. They have recorded an average of 1.1 million guests monthly.
Events and programs are organized all year round to facilitate engagement and
building of bonds with members and guests. These events are free for guests to
enjoy, or at an affordable fee to encourage membersâ€™ participation.  
This month they have celebrated the 30th anniversary of the facility with a
day of music, food and carnival fun. Now I learned that they call Downtown
East their lifestyle destination. It is not a service, or a privilege offered
to working people. On that day they even had a race in which 98 teams took
part. The event, called Downtown East 30, features star-studded local
musicians and bands including the likes of The Sam Willows and THELIONCITYBOY,
yummy treats at the food bazaar, fun attractions at the carnival, and engaging
activities at the Community Village.  
The hosts displayed professionalism and great style and care. The facility and
the people have convinced me that â€œBuild on trust, build to lastâ€ was not
only their slogan but their lifestyle too.  
I can see that Mr. Lee Kuan Yewâ€™s legacy is alive and well. His vision and
spirit that have made Singapore what it is today can be felt most vividly in
the Downtown East.

_**This is the second part about the journey on the New Golden Route of Japan
via Hokuriku by Le Thanh Hai from Vietnam Heritage  
**_

Leaving the Kenrokuen Garden of Kanazawa, we headed to the mountain and
arrived at the World Heritage site – the Gokayama Ainokura Gassho-style
village – around 8pm. Outside, the shape of the mountain was just visible in
the dark, and dim light from the windows revealed the slow-falling rain. An
older woman took three female members from our team in her small car and drove
us to her house. Her long, thatched-roof house was built over 300 years ago
and her family has been living there for generations. In the middle of the
house, there was a hearth with some fish on skewers and a boiling pot. Her
house had a simple interior with tatami mat, a TV set in the corner and
sliding doors to the sleeping tatami rooms. We had a home-stay night at this
house, with warnings not to walk to other neighboring houses or gardens, out
of respect the privacy of each owners.  
The home owner had prepared dinner for us in the Japanese tradition with wild
vegetables that her husband picked up from the mountain, tofu and rice of the
region and the fish grilled on the fire. While we ate, she went around
silently making up the sleeping mats for us.  
The next morning, I couldnâ€™t help but run up and down the small roads of the
village and around the neighboring houses. I had never seen such beautiful
surroundings. The magical setting of the village stole my heart. The fresh
rice fields were greenish yellow and the houses on the small curving roads
with time-colored, thatched roofs were like something from mythology. A garden
by a neighboring house had lots of big yellow pumpkins reminding me of the
approaching Halloween.  
At breakfast, I learned that Gassho-style housing was born from the wisdom of
people who live in the snow. The steep thatched roof covering the house was
designed to ensure space for sericulture as well as provide ventilation and
daylight, and more importantly, the snow piled up on the roof will easily
slide down.  
Some of the Gassho-style houses in Gokayama are over 400 years old. How have
these wooden buildings survived for so long? Gassho-style housing always has
an Irori hearth for cooking and warmth. The smoke rising from these fires
repels insects and prevents the aging of the building.The ingenuity and wisdom
of Gassho-style housing really represents the lives of the Japanese who have
lived in harmony with nature.  
We visited the Japanese handmade paper (washi) workshop in the village and had
a 15-minute experience producing our own paper art with the owner of the
house.  
Washi is one of of Japanâ€™s most fundamental artistic products. During 1,300
years of its production, it has formed the backbone of many other Japanese art
forms. In fact, washi paper is so ingrained in Japanese culture, there are
literally towns build around washi paper making  
Because Japanese paper-making depends on natural materials, the production of
washi paper became a seasonal activity. Winter was typically considered the
best paper-making season, as the weather was too cold for farmers to be out in
their fields doing other work. Most washi paper uses kozo, and mitsumata, two
shrubs that are generally cultivated, and gampi, which is typically wild. The
plants are boiled and beaten, to get the fiber for paper pulp substance.  
A mat is swirled gently in water with paper pulp four times to get the desired
thickness of the paper sheet. The sheet then gently taken out and put on a
heating machine to remove extra water and dry. We put some paper flowers on to
the sheet and another round for a second sheet to put on top, keeping the
paper flowers in between.  
In the shop, there were lots of souvenir items made with washi paper.  
However, there are only a few families in the region who still make
traditional washi paper.  
We also visited the Museum of Sericulture, Folk Handicrafts and Photographs
Yusuke. The special thing about this Museum is the house (Gashho-zukuri House,
built in 1868) has a pin-connected structure, using no nails but only ropes!
The first floor of this farm house was built by carpenters specializing in
temples and shrines; the second and third floors were made with the
cooperation of villagers. You can see the internal structure of this
traditional farmhouse, learn the history and customs of Ainokura Village
through photographs and drawings with description panels and watch the ancient
Japanese folk Kokiriko dance. The dancer plays a sasara, which consists of 108
wooden pieces and sings a cheerful melody. It is said that Kokiriko was
introduced to Gokayama from the ancient capital 1000 years ago. It was sung at
religious ceremonies to pray and appreciate good harvest.  
â€œIf you want to dance, let me hold your crying baby while you dance. The
sasara is near the window, so why donâ€™t you pick it up and dance?â€
(Kokiriko lyrics).  
We didnâ€™t have much time to linger at this Unesco World Heritage site, as
another destination awaited â€“ the wood carving town of Inami in Toyama
Prefecture.  
Built around Zuisenji Temple 600 years ago, this town is home to approximately
200 of Japanâ€™s finest wood carvers. Wood carving workshops line the stone-
paved Yokamachi streets, with everything from bus signs to doorplates artfully
chiseled out of wood. We walked with appreciation of the chance to be in
Japanâ€™s best wood-carving town.  
The birth of Inami Town originates back to 1390, when the Emperor Gokomatshu
ordered a Buddhist priest, St Shakunyo, to build Zuisenji Temple. Since then,
this town has been developing as a town blessed with Buddhist prosperity. Many
carpenters from other parts of Japan moved here to work, built the Zuisenji
Temple and stayed on. There was a legend about the main gate of the temple; in
1879 when a fire broke out from the main hall and the gate was about to catch
fire, a wooden dragon got out from the gate, swallowed water from the deep
well and put the fire out. The main gate which the Japanese call the San-mon
is designed an important cultural asset  
The main hall is the 4th largest wooden building in Japan. It is 40 meters
wide, 45 meters long and has the floor space to fit 450 tatami straw mats.
Inside the hall are 86 towering columns made from the wood of the keyaki
(zelkova) tree.  
On Yokamachi Street from time to time we saw girls in beautiful traditional
kimonos. There was a kimono tour on offer, with Yukata (summer kimono from
July to September) and kimonos from September to March with hair styling
service optional as well. The price for 4 hours rental of kimono plus lunch
and Shogawa River cruise is from Y7200 to 7800 and reservation is required (at
[www.tabi-nanto.jp/nantabi/tabi/](http://www.tabi-nanto.jp/nantabi/tabi/)
kimono_tour.html).  
Toyama is the hometown of Fujiko F. Fujio, one of the two authors of the
famous Doraemon manga. I remembered my sonâ€™s eagerness to get hold of every
new issue of the book in Vietnamese and how he was happy when I decorated his
room, cases and desk with Doraemon the magic cat. I traveled with joy on the
Doraemon tram with images of the characters of the manga painted all over. It
seemed that we all reporters turned kids again when we took lots of group
photos together on the tram. I believe the energy of the magic cat was the
real influence. It was a pity that we didnâ€™t have time to visit Fujiko F.
Fujiâ€™s Hometown Art Gallery. It would be interesting to know more about him,
the author with an imagination for the 22nd century.  
From Toyama to Tokyo, it took us just 2 hours and 8 minutes ride on the
Hokuriku Shinkansen. Spacious, convenient and smooth bullet train with every
seat fitted with its own power socket. Excellent! Getting out from the JR
Station in Tokyo, we met a totally different world, full of lights and high-
rise buildings, busy traffic and beautifully lit western classic architecture.
We headed for the Digital Art Museum, Odaiba.  
I didnâ€™t expect much until I entered the corridor as black as ink.
Butterflies appeared and I had the urge to touch them, although there was a
warning at the entrance: If you touch the butterfly it will die and disappear.
The more I walked, the more butterflies followed and took the lead, and all
around me were the flowers and leaves and waves of butterflies. I walked into
the forest, seeing flowers booming and moving, plants growing, water
fallingâ€¦what a sensation!  
The art is dynamic and constantly in motion. In just a few minutes, you can
experience a complete change of scenery. Step back into that same flower
forest a little later, and youâ€™ll find that the seasons have changed!  
The museum combines science, art, technology, design and images of the natural
world with simulations generated by 520 computers and 470 high-tech
projectors. With over 107,000 square feet of space, the museum has 50
interactive displays that blend into one another over five different zones.
The exhibitâ€™s â€œborderlessâ€ name encourages breaking down barriers
between one piece of art and another, art and its visitors, and one person and
another.  
After experiencing some of the space that seemingly never ends, we had to
leave to check in at Henn Na Hotel Tokyo Asakusabas. Greeting us were two
female robots in nice uniforms and who were able to nod! Everything was
operated online. While it is very convenient and comfortable, I still wished
to have human interaction at hotels.  
My last day in Tokyo, I explored the Edo Tokyo Museum, the Sky Tree Television
Tower and the shopping area at Sensouji Temple. 2018 marks the 150th
anniversary of the birth of Tokyo. On July 17, 1868 an imperial edict was
issued changing the name of the capital of Edo to Tokyo and Tokyo Prefecture
was established. The city of Tokyo which made its start amid the chaos of the
Meiji Restoration, was destroyed repeatedly by earthquakes and war. The
exhibition, â€œTokyo: 150 years at the Edo Tokyo Museumâ€ shows Tokyo at its
origin and captures how it changed over the 150 years through photographs,
films and maps.  
Tokyo Sky Tree is a broadcasting, restaurant and observation tower in Tokyo.
It became the tallest structure in Japan in 2010 and reached its full height
of 634.0 meters (2,080 ft) in March 2011, making it the tallest tower in the
world. The base of the tower has a structure similar to a tripod; from a
height of about 350 m (1,150 ft) and above, the tower’s structure is
cylindrical to offer panoramic views of the river and the city.There are
observatories at 350 m (1,150 ft), with a capacity of up to 2000 people, and
450 m (1,480 ft), with a capacity of 900 people. The upper observatory
features a spiral, glass-covered skywalk in which visitors ascend the last 5
meters to the highest point at the upper platform. A section of glass flooring
gives visitors a direct downward view of the streets below.  
After learning the history of Tokyo and having panoramic view of the whole
city from the Sky Tree, we did some shopping along the road full of souvenir
and bakery outlets leading to the Sensouji Temple.  
Sensouji, also known as Asakusa Kannon Temple, is a Buddhist temple located in
Asakusa. It is one of Tokyo’s most colorful and popular temples. The legend
says that in the year 628, two brothers fished a statue of Kannon, the goddess
of mercy, out of the Sumida River, and even though they put the statue back
into the river, it always returned to them. Consequently, Sensouji was built
nearby for the goddess of Kannon. The temple was completed in 645, making it
Tokyo’s oldest temple.  
Following other temple visitors, I made the Omikuji : I put Y100 into the box,
and thought of a wish while picking a wooden stick with a number that give
fortune readings. If the reading promises positive future people take it with
them, if it reads negative things, people tie the paper on the racks, to leave
the bad luck there.  
I wished I have the chance to explore more of Japan, and to take with me my
beloved family members. And the readings encouraged it !  
Seeing is believing, I highly recommend you to explore Japan soon to let
yourself enjoy your existence among breathtaking nature scenes, authentic art
and rhythm  
of culture evolution that is beyond imagination.

_In the next issue of Vietnam Heritage: World Heritage Ainokura Gasso Style
Village, Gokayama Yusuke, Inami Japan Heritage, Doraemon tram in Toyama
Prefecture; Digital Art Museum, Odaiba, Edo -Tokyo Museum, and Sensoujy Temple
in Tokyo._

  
It was a treasured opportunity for me to participate in a media excursion to
Japan recently, on behalf of Vietnam Heritage Magazine, together with
reporters from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines and
Hong Kong to explore the New Golden Route in the northwestern part of Honshu,
the main island of Japan. Four days touring from Osaka to Fukui, Ishikawa,
Toyama and lastly Tokyo on this new route in the Hokuriku (northwestern
region) awoke all my senses and love of life again.  
The devastating flood in early September of this year caused major damage to
Osaka International Airport, so my flight was changed to Narita Tokyo and a
domestic flight transit to Itami, a small airport near Osaka. We then took the
express train from Osaka Station to Awaraonsen in Fukui.  
I soaked in a relaxing hot water bath in my room at the Awara Onsen Mimatshu
Hotel and then fell asleep to the sounds of dripping water that reminded me of
a small stream burbling on the rocks. The first night in Awara City, Fukui
Prefecture, reinvigorated me after my long trip.  
Awara is famous for its many onsen or hot spring spas. The onsen at Awara date
back to 1883 when a farmer who was digging for a well accidentally discovered
a source of hot mineral water. There are now over 20 hot springs in the area.  
The food we had at the Awara Onsen Mimatshu hotel was delicious and served in
beautiful, dainty ceramic bowls and cups, one after another. We prepared the
beef ourselves at a table grill. Japanese beef has a juicy and sublime taste!  
Our tour guide from Fukui was proud of the areaâ€™s crabs. â€œThe Ichizen Gani
Crab from Fukui is considered fit for the Imperial Family. But unfortunately
it is not the season now. Crab season will be from November through March. You
must come backâ€, she said.  
The next morning, after another warm-up in the hotelâ€™s onsen, we headed to
Tojinbo Cliffs. A grandiose ocean view with high cliffs stretching along to
the coastline beckoned me to the edge of the cliff for a better view, but I
could only lie down, holding the camera tightly against the very strong wind
to take shots of the mighty crashing waves at the foot of the rock pillars.  
Those dramatic cliffs tower 20 meters or up to 30 meter over the rough waves
of the Sea of Japan. According to Wikipedia, the cliffs’ rocks were originally
formed 12 to 13 million years ago due to various volcanic activities.  
The legend of the place is touching. There, was a monk named Tojin who stayed
in the temple near this area, and he fell in love with a village girl but was
thrown off the cliffs by a warrior who also admired her. 49 days after his
death, there was a big storm in the sea. Villagers believed that was the
monkâ€™s spirit trying to show his anger and they named the cliffs after him
to appease him.  
Sadly, we didnâ€™t have time to ride the boat in this beautiful sea. Only in
winter the waves are too strong; at other seasons of the year the calm sea
allows safe boat service.  
Leaving the Tojinbo Cliffs, we had lunch in a small restaurant by the wood.
Edo is a stylish place with ancient decorative lamps and brilliant white
ambience. Our food tray had more than 40 colorful, appealing ingredients. I
thought I never had such pure-tasting water in my life.  
Painting is also a Zen activity. Our next stop was the Echizen Lacquer Ware
Urushi -no-sato where we were introduced to a lacquer ware-making process and
then taught to make our own drawings on mirrors and wooden trays.  
The master at the shop encouraged me while I colored my daisy with white and
gold. I desired to linger there and continue painting. As I left the class, I
stood still in front of the row of lacquer ware flower frames on the walls and
couldnâ€™t utter a word.  
The flowersâ€™ colors, shades and layers blended perfectly, with such subtle
and purity that they seemed to be alive. When at last I found my voice, I
could only exclaim â€˜How can it be?â€™ The master said, â€œI made them.â€ I
could only bow deeply to the master.  
Moving on, we headed to the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum. It is
recognized as one of the top dinosaur museums in the world, and is the largest
of its kind in Japan. The museum is located in Katsuyama City, Fukui
Prefecture, the center of dinosaur research in Japan and home to the country’s
largest and most prolific excavation site, just a few kilometers from the
museum.  
The Fukui Dinosaur Museum spans four floors. The main floor’s large open space
houses the museum’s principal Dinosaur World exhibition where more than 40
dinosaur skeletons are on display. They include examples of the local Fukui-
raptor and Fukui-saurus, which were found nearby, as well as several life-size
animatronic dinosaurs, including an incredibly life-like Tyrannosaurus Rex
that greets visitors as they enter the exhibition.  
My second day was spent in Kanazawa (City of Ishiwara Prefecture).  
When we stepped out of the Kanazawa Station, we entered a brilliant space. The
enormous beautiful dome above my head and the red Tsuzumi-mon Gate were beyond
imagination. I had seen them in photos but the feeling of being there is 1,000
times different.  
I often saw traditional red tori gates at the entrance to Japanese shrines,
marking the transition into a sacred space. And there the Tsuzumi-mon Gate
stood tall and massive in front of a station with the glass dome of the plaza
roof rising behind. A mix of modern style and convenience with the vivid
message of the ancient tradition is impressive, as is the immense glass dome
with solar panels.  
The next morning, we went to Nomura Samurai House, a historic home and garden
in Nagamachi, a very well-preserved district. Nagamachi was formerly the area
where the samurai of Kanazawa lived with their families. According to the tour
guide, today the area looks much the same as it did in the Edo era, with
canals and cobbled streets that run between earthen tile-topped walls. Nomura
Samurai House is one of the main attractions in this district.  
We walked in the clean stone streets, with very little traffic save one or two
bike riders, but lots of pine trees and bonsai in each house.  
The house we visited belonged to the Nomuras, a wealthy samurai family who
served the ruling Maeda family from the 16th century until the end of the Edo
period in the mid-19th century. At that time, the old social class system came
to an end, and many samurai houses were destroyed. The Nomura family also had
to sell a lot of their property and this house began to fall into ruin. A
wealthy businessman named Kubo Hikobei bought this property in the early 20th
century. Today the house is owned by the city and has been beautifully
restored.  
Inside there are heirloom antiques and artifacts of the past: a suit of
armour, beautifully painted fusuma screen doors, elegantly carved ranma
transoms. There is an inner garden adorned with stone lanterns, a small
waterfall, and a pond stocked with colorful koi fish. Many of the rooms of the
house are arranged so that this garden can be viewed from different angles.
The view from the second floor tea room is wonderful.  
This Nagamachi Samurai district is a must-visit place in Kanazawa. Some
minutesâ€™ walk to the bus station from the village and the bustling city with
its high rise buildings comes back again.  
Our next stop was the gold leaf shop â€œSakudaâ€ where we learnt to decorate
our own chopsticks with real gold. â€œIshikawa is the biggest manufacturer of
gold in Japanâ€, the shop owner told us when he led us from the ground floor
where two elderly workers in the shop skillfully counted the delicate gold
paper by breathing on it, to the exhibition hall on the second floor with lots
of golden items; paintings and sculptural works in gold, many gold paintings
priced at over 1 million yen ($8,800) each, and a bathroom with golden walls.  
The lesson to apply gold onto chopsticks took about 30 minutes, and I held my
breath carefully as only a little breeze can stir and make the super-thin gold
paper fly away. For tourists, a lesson is ¥500.  
After the gold leaf-crafting experience, we moved on to the 21st Century
Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa. The Museum is located in the centre of
Kanazawa, near Kenroku-en garden and the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art.
The collection at the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa is
focused on works produced since 1980 that “propose new values”.  
The ongoing exhibition near the entrance leaves a haunting impression. Through
glass window, in a vast white hall, I saw two figures in worn-out brown cloth,
one lying on the floor as if dead, and the other standing nearby and people
walking around to look at them. The pool is a curious exhibit as well. People
gather around to look down into the swimming pool. When I came closer , I saw
lots of people standing â€œin the waterâ€, taking photos of each other,
moving around and trying to climb to the surface. What meaning can be gleaned
from these works? In another room, which is as dark as night there was one
vertical tub with tiny coloured lights changing quickly. The work is called
â€œZen.â€  
We rested in a vast open room with a large square hole high above. The tour
guide said that it is the place to see the sky and enjoy the rain and the
snowfall.  
I left the Museum with thoughts about those creative works. All provoked
strong and contrasting emotion, curiosity and feeling of the great gift of
life which is hard to explain.  
We then walked to Le MusÃ©e de H, Kanazawa on a charming road with towering
trees on both sides. Le MusÃ©e de H is a confectionary shop where lots of
attractive cakes are on display. A tea-making ceremony was performed in front
of us; the lady at the shop gently offering us various type of teas for
tasting, including a cup of traditional tea with cream on top which was
exquisite. A pleasant-looking small soft cake with a touch of gold leaf on the
chocolate made it a perfect tea time.  
When we left the Confectionary shop for the Kenrokuen garden, it started to
rain. We walked in the rain with umbrellas to see the garden, which was
created for the Emperor of Japan  
Kenrokuen garden is justifiably classified as one of Japan’s “three most
beautiful landscape gardensâ€. The spacious grounds used to be the outer
garden of Kanazawa Castle and were constructed by the ruling Maeda family over
a period of nearly two centuries. It was opened to the public in 1871.  
The name Kenrokuen literally means “Garden of the Six Sublimities”, referring
to spaciousness, seclusion, artificiality, antiquity, abundant water and broad
views, which according to Chinese landscape theory are the six essential
attributes that make up a perfect garden.  
It was like a museum of trees, with boards telling the history or origin of
each plant. A big cherry tree that was moved from the Nagamachi Samurai
district to this garden was remarkable, as twenty houses had to be destroyed
to make room for transportation of the tree. A giant bonsai pine tree planted
from the 16th century, a mountain where the King enjoy watching the moon,
areas of valuable mosses carefully protected from birds, and forty thousand
lilies planted alongside the waterway are among many stories shared with us by
the tour guide as we admired the place.  
If there is a chance, I will come back to Kanazawa again and highly recommend
you visit this graceful green city replete with treasures new and old. With
the Hokuriku Shinkansen, it takes only more than 2 hours to get to Kanazawa
from Tokyo.

On 26 September, 1997, Ms. Ngo Thanh Loan opened the door of Bamboo Village
Resort to guests, with 14 Hawaiian style bungalows and a round dome restaurant
designed by architects who loved bamboo and pure Vietnamese beauty.  
In 1999, Bamboo Village added six more garden bungalows, a swimming pool with
Jacuzzi and rows of tall coconut trees looking out to the sea. Ms. Ngo Thanh
Nga joined as Managing Director of the company for the next 17 years.  
In 2001, Water Lily Spa opened, which is now ranked #1 Spa in Phan Thiet and
awarded Best Spa Destination in Vietnam.  
In 2006, when Mui Ne beaches suffered severed erosion, Bamboo Village
pioneered in finding a solution for environment protection, by building a soft
jetty with geotechnical fabric. This dear memento is now lying deep beneath
this peaceful beach.  
In 2017. Bamboo Village occupancy reached 82.28%, a great result given the
current economic time. The number of guests staying in 20 years exceeds more
than one million people.  
To date, there are total 147 rooms, serviced by 203 professional employees who
can speak some of English, French, Russian, German, Chinese and Korean.  
2018 marks 20th anniversary of Bamboo Village and new leadership, with Ms.
Pham Phuong Dung as Managing Director and Sofia Pham as Deputy Director.

â€œThe year was 1995. My mother and I visited Phan Thiet for the first time.
We came here to see the full eclipse, and somehow my mother fell in love with
this unknown coastal town. Everyone thought she was crazy when she wanted to
build a traditional Vietnamese-style resort here. Mind you, there were very
few hotels in Mui Ne 20 something years ago. This land was completely raw,
untouched and undeveloped, and my mother, while a very successful advertising
executive, had no experience in tourism or construction.  
That didnâ€™t stop her from purchasing the land and for the next couple of
years, she commuted from HCMC every weekend to build this resort from nothing.
She drained her life savings and put her time into what a lot of people saw as
a passion project with little chance of profitability.  
Despite the naysayers, my mother persevered and continued on her path. Good
thing she didnâ€™t quit, because not only has she built one of the greenest,
most visited destinations in Vietnam, she also built a community of
passionate, hardworking and blissful bamboo villagers who love their jobs and
treat their guests as if theyâ€™re part of the family.  
I grew up in two cultures, Vietnamese and American. I received a business
degree from UC Berkeley and with a typical American mindset, I wanted to build
my own career in California. I worked at the top three advertising agencies in
San Francisco for the next eight years after graduation. My career was very
intense and demanding but it also taught me a lot. However, I woke up one day
realizing what was missing from my job was passion and purpose. I created work
for brands that I didnâ€™t love or believe in.  
I grew up with Bamboo Village Beach Resort & Spa as my second family; I
believed in it and knew we could take it to new heights. I decided to join my
motherâ€™s journey to help Bamboo Village Beach Resort & Spa achieve
international recognition, making it more accessible to the world and bringing
more people from different cultures to our green village.  
My mother has created something very special here â€” a legacy made possible
by bamboo villagers. Itâ€™s a legacy that gives us joy and purpose, and one
that we would be proud and honored to continue for the next 20 years.  
Here is our promise to you, mom. We will embrace your legacy with pride and
innovation. We will make Bamboo Village Beach Resort & Spa the top destination
for spa, weddings and honeymoons. We will share our resortâ€™s unique beauty
and culture with the world and make it a destination to remember for all of
our guests. We will give back to the local community and support eco-tourism.
And when we hit a rough patch, we will overcome it with the same strength and
dignity as you would have.â€

the founder of Bamboo Village Resort on the 20th Anniversary Party. Sophia
Pham is now Head of Marketing and Deputy Director of Bamboo Village

11/20/2019,AWAKENING THE INFINITE POTENTIAL IN KIDS WITH MEDITATION,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/awakening-the-infinite-potential-in-kids-with-meditation/,,,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Capture4.JPG&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_6823.JPG,"Meditation is a method which can help improve kid’s thinking ability to be
sharper, enhance their long-term concentration, increase their inference and
especially improve the ability to be patient that any kids should work on.

Many parents are extremely surprised with their children’s peaceful and
carefree face while they are meditating at Vo Tan Khong’s Meditation class for
kids. That is the practice to improve the inherent focus ability in each kid
and it is best promoted by meditating. Because of that, they become more
courageous, their inner potential will be awakened which gives them the
confidence to do what they want.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Capture4.JPG)

All kids are constantly active either playing or thinking, there is no break,
so if they can just keep their eyes closed for a few minutes, it is already an
amazing turning-point. The potential inside of them will be awakened at their
very your age. As a result, the efficiency of meditation provides kids the
ability to control their mind in every action and clearly improves the
language in every of their sayings. Orienting them to calmness and easily
balancing the emotions inside. Through that, kids can initiatively express
more feelings towards their grandparents as well as parents, also easily get
along well with other relationships such as brothers, sisters and friends.

Vo Tan Khong’s Meditation method for kids is integrated with both activeness
and inactiveness in every games and activities suiting different ages. There
are games that help increase kid’s focus. Meditation is not just about
sitting, in fact, whatever activities that can make kids highly concentrated,
then that is meditation.

Along with those activities, they can have a chance to naturally absorb some
interesting theories aiming at expanding their viewpoint on life through very
usual concepts.

For kids who are unable to meditate yet, they can still have a concept and get
familiar with peaceful meditation-sitting through the images of older brothers
and sisters meditating. After a period of time taking part in Vo Tan Khong’s
Meditation class for kids, the parents are very happy seeing their children
getting more mature day by day with very clear changes from health to high
concentration in learning.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_6823.JPG)

The Meditation class for kids of Vo Tan Khong’s Meditation was established and
led by Master Tran Thanh Nghi. This is the first and only class that guides
children from 2 to 18 years old. Due to the spirit of sharing new learning
method to help kids be more peaceful and develop their thinking, the class is
absolutely free of charge.

Making dried longans, Bao Chau Village, Hung Yen Province. _Photos: Ngo Vi
Quang_

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/hung%20yen.jpg)

**Longan is a gift of heaven for the land of Hung Yen Province. Itâ€™s
inconceivable that the alluvial land of the Red River produces such exquisite
longan, called the king of all longans, only within Hung Yen Province.  
**

The famous scholar Le Quy Don described, â€˜as it falls inside the mouth, the
flavor penetrates the whole palate like a heavenly elixir.â€™ Indeed, Hung Yen
longan is very special, diferent from those grown elsewhere. The fruit is
round and big; the light brown peel is thin; the pulp is thick, ivory white,
dry to the touch but very succulent, delicately sweet, mind-refreshingly
aromatic, and the black round seed is tiny and shiny.  
Hung Yen longan usually has in its Vietnamese name an additional word
â€˜lá»“ngâ€™ which may mean â€˜cageâ€™ or â€˜interfoldâ€™. Some say because
the heavenly smell of longan attracts bats, birds and all kinds of other
pests, people used to make bamboo cages to protect the fruits. Some others say
that the king of longans, fit for kings, was given to the royal court as a
tribute every year, packaged in glass cages. The most plausible explanation is
that the pulp has many layers that fold around on another, making it more
opaque than the longans from elsewhere.  
Hien Pagoda in Hung Yen City has an age-old longan tree, considered the
ancestral tree of all and a symbol of the region. It is believed that this
ancestral tree is the progenitor of all longan trees in the province that gave
the land its fame. The tree even has a stele with inscription of its merits.
Legends have it that once a mandarin passed by the place when the longan had
ripened. He tried and found it exquisitly majestic. Recognizing this a
valuable specialty, he brought some of it to the court to give the King. The
fame of the longan quickly spread far and wide. Since then, every early
autumn, people brought the longan to the court to make tribute to the King and
the longan got a new name: tribute longan.  
Longan flowers bloom in spring, during cold drizzling days. But on rare warm
sunny days the delightful aroma spread enrapturingly.  
The fruits ripen in the sixth and seventh lunar months. Heavy bunches of
fruits of longan trees that grow on roadsides pull down the branches so low
that passers by can pluck and enjoy the cool sweetness.  
A refreshing fruit, longan is also very good for health. It has high calorie
content, low fat, and is very rich in vitamin C that improves our immune
system. Just peel it, remove the seed, then sun dry for a few days until the
pulp becomes brown and lithe, and we have dried longan, which is sweet and
aromatic but can be kept for a long time and used for many other purposes. It
can be steeped in vodka for a certain amount of time, which then can be taken
a small glass a day to improve oneâ€™s appetite and sleep and stablize oneâ€™s
mood. Longan is a natural wonder when it comes to nerve-related disorders and
illnesses, especially insomnia and depression. It helps the nerves relax and
improves their active functionality.

Bac Son Valley, Lang Son Province, October, 2014  
 _Photos: Nguyen Anh Tuan  
_

Located about 160km North of Hanoi, Bac Son is a small town in Lang Son
Province, lying in a mesmerizingly scenic valley, embraced by green mountains
and the soft band of a river that runs amid golden ripening paddy fields.  
The time between July and November is the best to visit Bac Son. The whole
valley is covered in the shining gold of ripening rice that is sure to take
anybodyâ€™s breath away.  
Towards the end of this period the valley is like an artistâ€™s pallet with
gold patches of ripened rice, reddish patches of havested fields, and rare
green patches of late ripening rice. Under the sun zig-zagging canals look
like stripes of tin that bundle all this bursting colors together.  
Bac Son rice fields are unique due to the surounding walls of rolling lime
mountains that ripple to infinity. Dusk and dawn are the best times of the day
to see sunrays penetrating those walls to animate the whole picture.  
The best spot from which to photograph the area is Na Lay Peak at 600m above
sea level. Almost all tourists who have come to Bac Son have stood here to
capture the majestic panorama.  
One should start climbing at 4 in the morning in order to capture cotton-like
clouds wiping the pallete.  
On the way back, one can visit the nearby community tourist center Quynh Son.
It is a village of Tay ethnic people with wooden stilted houses built in the
traditional style that blends well with the scene of the mountains, forests
and rice fields.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/lang%20son.jpg)

**Transportation  
** From Hanoi one can reach Bac Son by the Thang Long Bridge â€“ Noi Bai â€“
Soc Son â€“ Thai Nguyen route or the Thanh Tri Bridge â€“ Huu Lung route. Both
take about five hours.  
Having arrived at Bac Son, ask for the way to Na Lay Peak. Cars can be left in
a local house at the foot of the hill for about VND30,000 a night. Conditions
should be negotiated before leaving the vehicle to avoid misunderstanding
later.

**Lodging  
** It should not be hard to find a place to stay at night in Bac Son, as it is
an attractive tourist destination of Lang Son Province. The price is around
VND200,000 a room a night.  
Alternatively, to make it easier to be ready on Na Lay Peak at dusk and dawn
one can bring or hire a tent to set up right on the peak. Because there is a
telephone signal transmission station here, be sure to get permission from the
local authorities before you camp.

For ages, swallow nests have been known for top nutritional values and ranked
among the 8 most fabulous dishes. As they were rare and very hard to get, in
the past only royal families had the privilege to enjoy them.  
A nest is formed as follows: Birds of the aerodramus fuciphagus germani group
stretch their glue-like saliva into threads and attach them to a rock wall of
a cave to start making the base. More and more such threads are added, or
woven to form a nest. In Vietnam, these birds live mostly on islands,
especially the ones off the coast of Khanh Hoa Province. They are actually
granite rocks jutting out from the water, featuring sheer cliffs and
precarious caves. Due to rich special mineral content inside and around the
islands, our swallow nests have a distinct flavor and are superior in
nutritional content as compared to swallow nests elsewhere. The special
mineral content, rich in iron, of the environment surrounding a few specific
islands of the Khanh Hoa Sea help produce the most precious of all swallow
nests: the red nests.  
Modern scientific analyses show that swallow nests have glycoprotein
structure, are high in energy, and very easily digestible. They contain a
large number of high content amino acids, many of which cannot be produced by
human body. They also contain chemicals that aid in quick recovery from
injuries; stimulate red blood cell production, stabilize nerve and brain
cellsâ€™ functions, stimulate intestine functions, fight aging and harmful
radiation, strengthen muscle tissues, support cell reproduction, improve the
immune system, improve liver functions, help the body absorb substances that
prevent oxidization, wrinkles, pimples, freckles, and balance protein intake
for those who are on a diet or play sports.  
In January 2016 researchers from top Chinese universities have published in
Drug Design, Development and Therapy their findings about the effects of
swallow nests from Khanh Hoa Salanganes Nest Co. Ltd, Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa,
Vietnam. They have established that these nests boost the amount of B-cells
which produce antibodies that fight harmful agents from the environment and
cancer cells. They concluded that Khanh Hoa swallow nests can at least slow
down the development of cancer cells and improve the results of chemotherapy
for cancer patients.  
In fact, Khanh Hoa swallow nests were named â€˜Delicacy for Kingsâ€™ not by
the Vietnamese themselves but by food experts and lovers all over the world.  
So, Khanh Hoa natural island swallow nests are truly superior in taste, flavor
and health improvement qualities. To better serve the need of health
improvement of our consumers and the demands of general market with high
quality swallow nests harvested from the nature, Khanh Hoa Salangane Nest Co.
Ltd constantly conducts scientific research toward sustainable development.
According to Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Floraâ€™s executive body, Khanh Hoa Salangane Nest Co. Ltd is South-
East Asiaâ€™s best company in swallow nest resource management and sustainable
development. As of 2015, Khanh Hoa Salangane Nest Co. Ltd holds Asiaâ€™s
records in number of offshore swallow nest caves and in swallow nest yield.  
Khanh Hoa Salangane Nest Co. Ltd for health and welfare of consumers and
communities!

Nha Trang South, stretching from breathtakingly spectacular Long Beach up to
modern hi-tech structured Cam Ranh Airport, has recently turned into a
promising chic Riviera of the line of bright new luxury resorts being placed
in the oases of white sands with sparkling waters with Cam Ranh Bay as a
backdrop. The bay impresses one from a plane window by the full spectrum of
the blue and deep emerald bead necklaces of islands and islets framed in gold
,with the sandy bottom shining through the shallow waters. The touchdown in
Nha Trang is very possibly one of the most spectacular ones in the whole
country, at any hour of the day. The plane descendsdown the vast blue
continuum of the sparkling sea at sunny daytime and lifts the sadly-departing
up, high above the resort city by night with a myriad of city lights; the
brightly lit and never-ending Nha Trang esplanade and garlands of lamps from
the 2-km longcablecar line from the mainland to the island.  
Nha Trang South welcomes visitors with blooming bougainvilias in bunches and
lines embellishing the median strip of the road .The owners of brand new Cam
Ranh Riviera Beach Resort & Spa, where I was heading, could not have chosen a
better name for the property, as it catches the very vibe of the surrounding
seascapes. So does the resort main building, all white, light and contemporary
designed with a gentle hint of sea cruise liners. The spacious lobby, opened
to the cooling sea breeze, serves as a gateway to the CamRanh Riviera Beach
Resortâ€™s vast premises, which comprise 10 hectars of lush tropical terra
verde running right into the blue sea. While sitting in the lobby lounge, one
can watch through a huge â€˜screenâ€™ of panoramic non- framed windows the
tops of verdant coco-trees rolling in deep green waves, the still silver water
of the upper pool and the lines of white villas hiding in the shade of young
bamboo groves and out farther into the unterrupted spaces of the ocean.  
A short walk down the stairs and a stroll through an expansive restaurant
where full-board buffets are included in the â€˜boarding pass to the resortâ€™
are being held all day long with short breaks, and one finds oneâ€™s self at
the doors into the tropical green corridor to the ocean. On the way to the 200
m-wide private beach there are more surprises deserving closer attention: a
huge lotus pond in full bloomwith a chorus of frogs on duty, and butterflies
and birds performing whirling dervish dances on neatly kept lawns. Green lawns
are also grown on the curved roofs of Ocean View and Beach Front Villas to put
them in perfect harmony with floral surroundings. The coco groves change into
whiteplumeria alleys leading to an infinity pool all alive with anaquaerobic
session.  
The interiors of the Ocean View Villa I was assigned to are simply striking
and can be described as â€˜over the topâ€™, with great work clearly revealed
throughout. An impressive 115 m²,featuring a two-level main room in white ,
chestnut, light silver and ultramarine blue colors, ornate wooden screen,
closet room and huge bathroom with attached open-air shower and a steamboat of
a bathtub.Add a private garden, a blossoming tree stretching its branches
above the shower and throwing flowers at oneâ€™s feet, private pool framed
with exotic greenery growing and floating in a little nearby pond.  
The resort is truly expansive, with exquisite accomodations, featuring 226
rooms, ranging from elegant Deluxe Sea View Rooms featuring private glass
â€˜ship decksâ€™ of balconies, elegant studios and suites to top end
Beachâ€“Front and Ocean View villas.  
The private sandy beach in the Nha Trang area looks sensational. Calm waters
with light waves in the afternoon and a gradual descent from shallow to deep
promise a swim of the century.  
All the elements to ensure and provide memorable pleasuresfor the guestsâ€™
free time such as a chic and cozy spa center, a modern gym with state-of-the-
art equipment, an open-air night cinema, and a wide array of health-boosting
and animation programs are definitelyhere.  
With over 30 hotels and resorts in Vietnam visited and reviewed during my long
stay in the country, I did actually keep my calmbefore impressive facilities
and interiors of Cam Ranh Riviera Beach Resort & Spa, but I surrendered to the
images of kids hunting for frogs at night in the garden, flying butterflies,
dancing birds, frogs peering into the spa through windows and watching you
from the pools edge while you are enjoying a late nite driftnhamaydienkhi,
handsome macho men and granddaddies playing poolball like toddlers.The lady
all in gold , with red manicure and chic swimming suit all of a sudden jumping
in the sea riding the seahorses for a good 30 minutes dealt the final blow.
Verdict: Exceptional. Impossible to remain impartial in this review.

Having just had one new experience of an aroma, I received a text message
inviting me to another one. I never knew before that the small of a whole
roasting dog was actually quite pleasant, just as most roasts are. My daughter
had warned me that members of my sister-in-law with whom we were spending a
public holiday had slaughtered a dog, but this had not prepared me for this
sight and smell as I sat out resting in the courtyard of my sister-in-lawâ€™s
dragon fruit farm house. Then there was a buzz on the phone and I read a
message saying that as I was already in the vicinity and would I like to
experience the delights of â€˜The Aroma Beach Resort and Spaâ€™ at Phan Thiet?  
A more idyllic setting for a seaside sojourn you could not wish for. The
creation of a promontory makes for a secluded yellow sandy beach. The resort
slopes down a bank at an angle of around forty degrees, making it steep enough
as well large enough to warrant a buggy to take you and your baggage to your
room. These rooms are housed in bungalows villas, suites and superior suites.
The last two categories have their own indoor or outdoor Jacuzzis. All the
accommodation is of mock stucco walls with thatch and bamboo roofs giving you
the feeling of living in a rustic village of yesteryear. The location is near
the ancient Cham towers of Poshanu and is not actually in Mui Ne, but just
before, in Phu Hai ward of Phan Thiet City.  
All of this is set in among the most beautiful of tropical gardens. Each
section of the resort is named after the flower which prominently grows around
it. There is jasmine, lemongrass, plumeria, peppermint,frangipani and nenuphar
(water lily). This, of course, along with the empty bird cages placed among
the trees attracts the bird life. Very prominent and tame enough for you to
get up close are the rufous-bodied hoopoes with their regal crest of feathers
on their heads, which always appear in pairs with their long curved bills
picking out the worms on the lawns. Seated out on my upper floor balcony, I
was also entertained by a beautiful slinky lizard half way up a coconut tree
below me.  
One might think the hotel takes its name from the fragrances of its abundant
flowers, but there is more to it than that. In the room, there was an oil
burner with a small candle to vaporize the oil. There is an oil for everyday
of the week – lemongrass, rose, sweet orange, peppermint, ginger grass,
cajuput and lavender. We had to call reception for it, but a staff member was
round in a jiffy,had everything lit and our room was smelling as sweetly as a
spa for the rest of the evening. Here I have to commend the friendly and well-
trained staff. They will not let you carry a bag for half a metre!  
This hotel is all about relaxing and restoring body and soul. Fittingly, there
is a spa centre with full massage services,sauna and steam bath and you work
out at the fully equipped gymnasium next to it. For shoulder exercise, there
is even a mini-golf course. If you do not want to take a dip in the vast blue
ocean, there is a full-length swimming pool by the beach. The kids are well-
catered for, as there is a paddling pool for them and a bamboo see-saw, swings
and a springy set out on a lawn and under shady trees. The Tansy Restaurant,
serving Vietnamese,Asian and European delights have an outdoor area where you
can enjoy a romantic evening. We sat there for breakfast. The beach is a
working one-not just for holiday makers. We thought we were starting the day
early but we watched as fisher folk in basket boats landed their first haul of
the day.  
A beach holiday can be a bit boring, but there is plenty to do outside near
the hotel and in BinhThuan Province. Within walking distance, there is the
Sand Sculpture Exhibition with works on Vietnamese and World fairy tale themes
by artists from thirteen different countries and there is a cultural show in
an open air theatre called â€˜The Fishermen Showâ€™. A taxi ride will take you
to the Poshanu towers, a relic from one of the world’s most amazing cultures.
The hotel also organises excursions. There is a day trip to the nineteenth
century Co Thach Pagoda set in a grotto high on a hill above a coloured pebble
beach and there a half day trips to the Ke Ga (Chicken Coop) lighthouse on an
islet reached by canoe or basket boat and to the famous white dunes of Mui Ne.  
Vietnam can be noisy, hectic and hard work even for the tourist. If you want
to spend a few quiet days in a rustic setting but with all modern comforts and
the possibility of some rewarding activities, this could be the place for you.
The gardens are sheer paradise, but luckily apple trees cannot grow here and
the lemongrass wards off snakes. Also I was with the wife, so no woman here
led me into temptation – just blue sky, yellow sand and greenery!

**From the rocks to the sea to the plant life,  
Otter Lair paints a pretty picture.  
**

In recent years, Hang Rai (Otter Lair) became a famous place that has
mesmerized many tourists and photographers for its mythical, untouched beauty,
especially at dusk and dawn.  
Hang Rai is actually a seashore field of myriads of rocks and stones of all
shapes and sizes overlaying each other above and under the water, just outside
the famous Nui Chua (Lordâ€™s Mountain) National Park.  
Spreading over 29,865 ha, which includes 7,352 ha of sea water, Nui Chua
National Park is one of the most unique â€˜drought forestsâ€™ of Vietnam, and
perhaps of Southeast Asia too, one that houses a diverse fauna and flora
system.  
From the Phan Rang city of Cham Towers, follow the beautiful coastline highway
to Tri Thuy Bridge, turn right to Provincial Highway 702, go 35km, and one
will see Hang Rai at Thai An Village, Vinh Hai Commune, Ninh Hai District of
Ninh Thuan Province.  
Looking from afar, one may be disappointed at the sight of dark, unassuming
rugged terrain. But coming nearer, visitors get more and more excited by the
fabulously arranged rocks and stones that stand there for millions of years,
proudly facing natureâ€™s elements.  
The colours alone at Hang Rai are enough to envoke wild associations. Some
even think that this place reminds them of Marsâ€™ surface.  
Wave after wave rams onto the rocks, throwing up white, foaming masses that
look like dead coral reefs.  
As the waves recede, water oozes from between the rocks and stones as if
squeezed out of a sponge.  
Sunlight also has its effect on the colours and shades of Hang Rai, making it
change constantly from glorious morning to dreamy evening.  
As the first rays of the sun paint the horizon rose and reflect on Hang Rai
stones, the whole scenery becomes otherworldly and surreal. Many tramping
sightseers and professional photographers camp overnight here just to catch
this glorious moment.  
A seasoned photographer named Trung said, â€˜Hang Rai is most alluring from
Nov. to Feb. when the sea is rough. Itâ€™s the algae and sea weeds that do the
magic. Masses of seaweed that grow on the rocks beneath the water look like
enormous emerald carpets and dance nonstop with the waves. The algae also
change the shades of sea water as the sun makes its journey through the sky.  
Here and there, big rocks build up dykes to embank natural pools of calm and
cool water, so refreshing that even the hydrophobic feel the urge to take a
dip  
In addition, Hang Rai is surrounded by huge coral reefs. With just some simple
diving gear, one can submerge into the deep blue to see the spectacular hidden
treasures of the ocean.

**One can combine exploring Hang Rai and Nui Chua National Park with many
other exciting activities, such as watching sea turtles lay their eggs, hiking
to the 1039m-high peak of Nui Chua, seeing particularities of a drought
forest, learning the lifestyle and customs of Raglai ethnicity, visiting Ving
Hy Bay just a few kilometers from Hang Rai, scuba diving or seeing coral reefs
from glass bottom boats.**

11/20/2019,Exploring Nam Du Islands,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/exploring-nam-du-islands/,,By Dang Khoa,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/769-hon-nam-du-5535-A_l-S.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/895-thanh-binh-bai-ngu-nam-.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/161B-Bo-2-PC16-2-___ng-ra-_.jpg,"_(No.1, Vol.7,Feb-Mar 2017 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)

65km off the shores of Rach Gia City, Kien Giang Province, Nam Du Islands were
a refuge of Lord Nguyen Anh (1762-1820), notorious as the man who defeated the
Tay Son rulers to take the throne in 1802. This fact alone urged me to go
there. After 2 hours of bobbing on the waves, the group of 21 islets appeared
on the horizon. 15 minutes later, the high-speed boat docked in the harbour of
the Big One, a 500ha island which is the centre of An Son Commune, head of 15
inhabited islands.

**The milky way in the sea**

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/895-thanh-binh-bai-ngu-nam-.jpg)  
_Photo: Danh Thi Hong Nhung_

  
Having paid VND150,000 for a room, I took a walk around the Big One. A road
asphalted since the time of the French leads to the island peak, 295m above
the sea. The vastness of the sky and the sea at different layers opened before
my eyes.  
How big a personâ€™s heart must be to live in this borderless universe. To the
east of me, the centre of An Son Commune with about 300 roofs lining its
shore. On the west, Royal Beach fishing village with 200 roofs hides under
coconut trees, and hundreds of fishing boats bob lightly near the shore. The
lighthouse keeper told me, â€˜Itâ€™s called the Royal Beach because King Gia
Long used to live there.â€™ 3.5 nautical miles to the east Hon Ngang Island,
dwellings and boats looks like a town floating in the sea. Itâ€™s the only
island without vegetation cover. All other islands of Nam Du are covered with
a small forests, not tall, but quite dense.  
At nightfall, lighthouse’s beam begins to turn, scanning the sea with powerful
illumination. For the first time I have the sense of the night amidst the sea
under strong winds and myriads of stars. Electric lights of fishing villages
and fish farming rafts look like stars bobbing on the water. With its density
of houses and boats, Hon Ngang looks like the seaâ€™s Milky Way.  
The next morning I hired a boat to visit the neighbouring islands, Hon Non
Ngoai, Hon Nom Giua, Hon Nom Trong, Hon Dam, Hon Hang, Hon Moc, Hon Tre and
Hon Nhan. The dozen islands took me half a day of scouring. They all seem
pristine, untouched by men, with craggy rocks that look like crystallized
minerals.  
Every now and then I saw a lone house which seemed to have been carved by the
waves on the rock face for millennia. The boatman told me those belong to the
people who came here from the mainland about 5 years ago to settle. At that
time, they must have been true Robinson Crusoes.  
Passing by a little islet, the boatman said, â€˜This is the Shirt Isle. Itâ€™s
called so because King Gia Long once threw away a torn shirt on it.â€™

**Daily life on Hon Ngang**

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/161B-Bo-2-PC16-2-___ng-ra-_.jpg)

_  
Satisfied with the feast of clouds and waves around the Big One, I headed to
Hon Ngang, the centre of Nam Du Commune, which included the adjacent islets
such as Hon Dau, Hon Ong, Hon Bo Dap and Hon Mau.  
30 minutes later, I stepped onto the Hon Ngang Pier, where thousands of boats
of all sizes and fish farm cages docked. Hon Ngang is just a quarter of the
Big One in area, but it hosts about 700 makeshift houses which occupy nearly
half the area of this bald isle.  
I found myself on a web of dirt roads zigzagging amongst a dense forest of
huts. At the centre of town, there was a bazaar boiling in the heat of
trading. Dozens of fish steaming furnaces line the populated area. Life on Hon
Ngang is very typical of those faraway islands. Talking to some people at Hon
Ngang, I found that the folks here are very free and open-minded. Perhaps this
free spirit which I thought was boundless was there not only because the
island was part of the west of southern Vietnam (which nurtures freedom), but
also because itâ€™s so far from the mainland. A day spent on the island of Hon
Ngang was worth my while.  
The next morning I decided to visit Hon Mau, the most beautiful place of the
Nam Du archipelago. A 20 minute boat ride took me to the 100ha island. It was
so scenic compared to the bustling Hon Ngang. A 100-roof fishing village
huddled between two sandy beaches and three rock beaches, all tender and
undaunted: The Northern Beach, the Black Rocks, the White Rocks, the Untamed
Rocks and the Southern Beach.  
From Hon Mau, I headed directly to Hon Dau, a relatively large one compared to
the other islands. Primeval forests cover 95 per cent of the area. The 20
roofs of Home Beach fishing village hide under the canopy of 20 lush coconut
gardens. The life stories at this most peaceful village of Nam Du were just as
humbling.

**Because the sea around Nam Du rarely has storms or big winds, itâ€™s safe to
go all year round. But December to March is the best time, when Nam Du is most
beautiful and enjoyable. The only way to get there is from Rach Gia Harbour. A
speed boat ticket is VND500,000. A low-budget option is by usual boats with
two way ticket price at VND300,000 â€“ VND340,000. All boats to Nam Du leave
at 8-9 a.m. every day except when the weather is bad. Both Hon Ngang and Big
One have inns for tourists at VND150,000 â€“ VND200,000 a room. Otherwise, one
can negotiate to stay at a fishing family home. If you come to Nam Du in dry
season, please spare your drinking water to share with the locals.

Ngoc Linh is a mountain range with many peaks between 800m and 2800m high
scattered in Kon Tum, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Gia Lai Provinces. This
highest and grandest mass of Southern Vietnamese mountains channels much of
its water to Dak Di, the main tributary of Thu Bon River. Having descended
from the mountains, the water flows north, passing through Nam Tra My, Bac Tra
My, Tien Phuoc, Hiep Duc, Nong Son and Duy Xuyen Districts of Quang Nam
Province.  
In Duy Xuyen District, the flow changes direction to southwest â€“ northeast
to join with the Vu Gia River. Before entering the East Sea at Cua Dai
Estuary, Thu Bon River splits into Ba Chuom, Co Co, Dinh, Do and Hoi An
rivers.  
Thu Bon River has a total length of 198km. It is also the domestic river with
the largest basin in Vietnam.  
Passing through different landscapes and having many different branches, the
river scenes are very diverse. Its upstream is wild and majestic, while the
lower part is idyllic as it snakes through fertile paddies. Remarkably, Thu
Bon River goes through two world cultural heritage sites, My Son Sanctuary and
Hoi An Ancient Town.  
Many famous traditional trade villages such as Nong Son aloe wood village, Tam
Tang (Duy Xuyen) silk village and Thanh Ha (Hoi An) pottery village snuggle
next to the river banks. Since 17th century, their products have gone
downstream to Hoi An Harbour to spread to many destinations in the country and
abroad.  
The most famous section of Thu Bon is perhaps the one in Hoi An Old Town. This
is actually a small branch of Thu Bon that the Quang Nam people call Hoai
River. The usually slow and calm water intensifies the pensive feel of the
ancient streets. At the same time, as the convergence point of goods that come
to Hoi An Port, human activities around the Hoai River have always been
hectic. Today, it is even more bustling, transporting tourists from all over
the world for sight-seeing.  
Regarding the name of the main river, legends have it that once upon a time
foreign invaders killed Princess Thu Bon, daughter of King May and threw her
body into the river. Compassionate locals gave her a proper funeral. Then came
an epidemic, and people prayed to heaven for help. Princess Thu Bon heard
their laments and came to the rescue. Since then, the villagers named their
village and river after Her, built Her shrines and celebrate Her divinity
every year.  
Today, along Thu Bon River, there are many shrines and temples dedicated to
Her. Every 3rd lunar month, the Duy Xuyen people have a Lady Thu Bon
celebration to commemorate the person who made life on the river banks
peaceful and happy. Perhaps Thu Bon is the river most soaked in the cultural
heritage of Vietnam.  
To the people of Quang Nam, Thu Bon is the most sacred river of all. They call
it the Mother River.

Flat concrete roads took me through tunnels penetrating hills, vast rice
fields, Japanese houses scattered below the mountains, peaceful towns and
clear streams flowing by green moss and shiny rocks. Leaving behind the
crowds, modern landmarks and splendid landscapes of Osaka and Kobe, I headed
for rural areas in Kansai regions. Huge modern constructions always gain the
admiration of many people at first, but lovely little things or ancient things
always linger on your mind for a long time.

**Himeji CastLe, Hyogo Prefecture  
**  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Himeji-Castle-c43-2.jpg)  
Himeji Castle. _Photo provided by the management board of Himeji Castle_

  
Himeji Castle completely deserves to be recognized as a World Cultural
Heritage Site and National Treasure of Japan. A huge majestic wooden castle,
resplendent in its pure whiteness, looked like a bird swinging on the sky. It
is so impressive in every detail from the clean long moat, wooden drawbridge,
the gates, the tiles decorated with fish which are believed to protect it from
fires, the curving fan of stone walls, the long white-plaster walls, the
trimmed garden and more than 1,000 sakura trees.  
To encounter the Main Keep, I had to penetrate 21 gates, some with traps. The
gates are low and dark with the aim of hitting the careless heads of enemies.
Besides, the owner is very smart to use the conflict of the dark and light,
and the visual impacts to lead the enemies to go out of the castle. 997 murder
holes are equipped to defend the castle. However, no enemies have conquered
this castle yet.  
Externally, the Main Keep appears to have five floors. However, it actually
has a 7-floor configuration, including six internal floors and a basement.
Visitors are instructed to see hidden windows and doorways allowing escape,
warrior hiding places, weapon racks and platforms installed for monitoring and
firing on attackers.  
Certainly anyone also needs to lean on gods to find the strength, brave
warriors included. There is a small shrine at the top. On the walls, you can
see the six-petal nail covers used for decoration and covering nail heads.
Observing carefully, you can see small wooden plugs with a variety of shapes
on the beams. These proved that the owner is not only a good soldier, but also
an artist. Looking at the miniature backbone of the Main Keep, I admired their
talent. The tall pillars and stone walls at the base are one of the secrets to
protect the castle from earthquakes. After 45 years of restoration, the more
than 400-year-old castle still keeps its original shape and beauty through the
time.

**Somen Museum, Hyogo Prefecture**

Next I came to the Somen Museum for lunch. A big tent was raised in front of
the museum and served a summer dish â€“ somen noodles. Bundles of noodles are
dropped into cold flowing water. Everyone then tries to catch the noodles as
they flow by. It was a fun way to enjoy â€˜Nagashi Somenâ€™ with chopsticks.
Somen noodles are served simply with sauce, ginger, wasabi, green onion and
many kinds of tempura. Very cool and delicious, the noodles are firm. If you
canâ€™t eat somen noodles in summer, you can buy some in the shops and enjoy
at home.  
Somen was created in the 1880â€™s in Japan and is manufactured in a limited
period from October to the following April, because the process of making
Somen depends mostly on the weather. The Somenâ€™s secret is the process of
ripening and stretching, which is repeated several times. At the demonstration
corner in the museum, an old worker showed me how to thin and elongate the
noodles from 6mm to 1.3mm in diameter and from 50cm to 1.4m in length. The 2nd
floor introduces the history and culture of Somen with figures, panels and
audio visual material.

**Kinosaki Onsen â€“ Hot Spring Town, Hyogo Prefecture**

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Kinosaki-Onsen-Town-1.jpg)  
At the Kinosaki Onsen Town. _Photo: Pinterset._

As the sun went down behind the mountains, my coach went to the hotel Onishiya
Sushoen in Kinosaki Onsen Town, which near the Sea of Japan. Onsen in Japanese
means â€˜hot springâ€™. Volcanoes bring to Japan a valuable resource, the hot
spring, which is believed can soothe tense and tired muscles. There are plenty
of hot springs scattered through the country. Most of them are concentrated in
the countryside. So it is not difficult to find an onsen where you can soak
your body in warm water and enjoy breath-taking landscape.  
Onishiya Sushoen features a traditional Japanese hotel with a tranquillity
garden ornament at the lobby decorated with trimmed trees, rocks, sand, water
and colourful koi fish. The garden can be viewed from most of the rooms which
are furnished with tatami mats, Shoji sliding doors and futon for a Japanese
accommodation style.  
The hotel treated me with a Japanese Kaiseki dinner which satisfied my senses
of sight, smell and taste. Japanese cuisine has such a refined quality that it
is recognized as an art form. The dishes are served on trays in small portions
and great care in decoration. The cook seems to calculate the value of
nutrition carefully in a meal, including seafood, meat, vegetables, soup, rice
and fruits. Spices are not used very much, so as to make diners feel the
freshness of ingredients completely.  
Wearing yakuta, a kind of kimono, I went to the onsen in the hotel to
experience bathing with naked people. I was really shy. But, I thought, it
would be such a pity if I did not dare to try something new when travelling in
a foreign country. After taking off their clothes, everyone looked the same
anyway. Then the only thing to do was soak my body in warm water and let it
heal my muscles and mind.

**In Japan, every season has its own attraction. Spring, from March to May,
has sakura (cherries) flowers blossoming from South to North. Summer, from
April to August, has the lush of trees. Autumn, from September to November,
has momiji (maple leaves) turning from green to red and yellow from North to
South. Winter, from December to February, has snow.**

**Motoise Kono Shrine, Miyazu City, Shira**  
I could feel an invisible power as soon as I got to the Torii Gate, a typical
symbol seen at the shrines, at the Motoise Kono Shrine where the god of the
sun was enshrined. It is believed that when you go through the Torii Gate, you
step into a holy place of the gods. Shintoism and Buddhism are two main
religions in Japan. There are more than 80,000 shrines in this country, most
of them attached to a story of gods and featuring their original unique
architecture. Motoise Kono Shrine is a wooden ancient shrine built in the
style of Japanese traditional Shinto architecture. The shrine is decorated
very elegantly and located in a large area covering with old trees. You have
to go to its garden to listen the natural music from bamboo connected to the
ground. The beautiful sound is produced from water dropping into an
underground cave. This place is very tranquil.  
From this shrine, you can take a ropeway to Kasamatsu Park to enjoy a gorgeous
mountain and sea view from the air.

Road leading to Fukujuen, a tea shop in Kyoto.

I walked to Kamogawa, a famous river in Kyoto, to visit Fushimi Inari Shrine,
which has over 10,000 red Torii gates offered by entrepreneurs, arranged in
rows stretching over a 4km road leading to the shrine. Worshiping at Fushimi
Inari Shrine is said to bring prosperity in business and bountiful harvests.  
The ancient city of Kyoto, steeped in over a thousand years of history, lies
in a valley surrounded by mountains. The tourist mecca is famous for a
majority of ancient historical relics and beautiful natural scenes during four
seasons. Kyoto comprises 2,000 ancient shrines and pagodas.  
Kyoto will bring you back to Japan in the 19th century with ancient wooden
Japanese restaurants, stone lanterns, bamboo sliding doors, umbrellas, kimono,
wooden clogs and performances by geishas.  
Going through poetic streets, I found the way to Fukujuen, a tea shop in
Kyoto, which is located in an alley covered with high lush trees in the front
and a row of cherry trees along the channel behind. It is a nice place to
enjoy matcha which is a trendy drink recently loved all over the world. Matcha
is premium green tea powder from Japan used for drinking as tea or in recipes.
Matcha has been used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony for hundreds of
years. Nutritionists said that matcha is a â€˜super foodâ€™. It has 137 times
more antioxidants than regularly-brewed green tea. One cup of matcha is
equivalent to 10 cups of regularly brewed green tea in terms of nutritional
content.  
Sipping my matcha made by a Japanese instructor, it tasted bitter on my
tongue, but after that, only the light sweetness lingered in my mouth. Matcha
is usually served in a beautiful ceramic bowl decorated with seasonal flowers
in Japan. Flowers are drawn outside and inside the bowl with the aim of
letting the drinker enjoy the flower blossoms while drinking tea. Matcha and
Mochi, a Japanese cake, is a perfect couple. However, Matcha also blends with
other ingredients in perfect harmony.  
In Kyoto, there are plenty of Japanese ancient houses used as restaurants,
with impressive large garden ornament and geisha performances. The garden
changes its appearance during each of the four seasons. In summer, a balcony
floor built right above the Kamogawa River provides a perfect dining space for
authentic Japanese dishes, as the breeze from the river adds to the elegance.
It is a memorable afternoon at the restaurant Ganko Takasegawa Nijoen, with
good food, the sunset and mallards bathing on the river.  
Time went so fast and I had to go home with nice, unforgettable memories of
Japan, a developed country careful not to ruin the beauty of nature and its
unique traditional culture. Although expenses are high in Japan, many people
are ready to spend money on high quality products â€˜made in Japanâ€™, because
they get what they pay for. Japan gives you purity, fresh air and poetic
sceneries in every nook and cranny. A pebble in a spring, a tree in the
street, a flower, a lake, a forest, a mountain, a house, a shrine, a castle, a
building â€¦ all of them have a soul that makes Japan become really unique. It
is a place where you come once, then return home with a remembrance and after
that come back again. Come to Japan to find balance in the modern bustling
life.

Learning how to make tÃ² he (toy figurines); Experience of wearing Hue royal
costumes; Enjoying Hue food; Making Hue conical hats

Intending to create a rich, diverse exhibition environment for visitors,
especially for school children, Ho Chi Minh Museum had organized the outdoor
educational experience â€˜Chairman Ho Chi Minhâ€™s childhood in cultural
ambience of Hue.â€™ Taking place from 26 to 30 September 2016 at Ho Chi Minh
Museum, Hanoi, it is a continuation of previous educational programs which
help the public to explore and experience the region around the old capital,
rich in of traditional cultural values.  
Hue has a special place in Chairman Ho Chi Minhâ€™s youth. The 10 years 1895
â€“ 1909 spent in Hue were a very important period for young Nguyen Tat Thanh
â€“ Nguyen Ai Quoc â€“ Ho Chi Minh. It was this time and this place that
forged his patriotism, which urged him to go abroad looking for a way to save
the country and the people. Hue cherishes the images of His youth and
preserves the sanity of memories of how Chairman Ho Chi Minhâ€™s childhood was
nourished here.  
â€˜Cultural ambience of Hueâ€™ is a fresh breeze for the school age, with
lively, fun learning activities such as Mid-Autumn lantern-making, palm leaf
hat-making, painting Sinh village drawings, Chinese literacy learning. It
restores the settings of the old Duong No Village (now in Phu Duong Commune,
Phu Vang District of Thua Thien Province) where little Nguyen Sinh Cung
(Childhood name of Chairman Ho Chi Minh) began his first lessons of Chinese
literacy, scraping his first characters to learn how words reflect people. The
program has folk games with a lot of motor skills practice such as tug of war,
blind manâ€™s bluff, and figurine kneading. Also, Hue Features Restaurant is
here to offer typical Hue items of food for the public to enjoy.  
The exploration experience series in 2016 has lifted the interaction between
the Museum and the public to new heights. The new program proved to be
innovative and effective in teaching the kids about the life, legacy and moral
example of Ho Chi Minh. Having experienced the â€˜Cultural ambience of Hue,â€™
Nguyen Nhat Linh of class 6A5, Nguyen Tri Phuong secondary school, Ba Dinh
District, Hanoi said, â€˜I am happy and proud to be here with my peers to play
folk games, eat Hue food, practice writing Chinese characters and paint folk
art. The program taught me a lot about Chairman Ho Chi Minh and traditional
cultural features of the Vietnamese people.â€™  
It is anticipated that in 2017, beside the existing educational programs in
the exploration space on themes â€˜Uncle Hoâ€™s tire sandalsâ€™ and â€˜The
revolutionary Pac Bo,â€™ Ho Chi Minh Museum will continue introducing outdoor
educational programs with new content and on a new scale. We respectfully
thank the public and hope that they will remain by our side in future
journeys.

Welcome to Con Dao Island – a paradise of leisure and adventure travel. Con
Dao was listed by the US-based Travel and Leisure Magazine as one of the 20
most mysterious islands in the world with its â€˜sheer granite cliffs
bordering deserted beaches and crystal-blue waterâ€™. Besides this, Lonely
Planet has named Con Dao in its Top Asia spots for 2016. The magazine praised
the islandsâ€™ tropical forests, The sea water is turquoise and has incredibly
diverse marine species, from dolphins to sea turtles to beautiful coral reefs.

**Strolling in Con Son Island  
** Con Dao District, Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, includes 16 small and big
islands, Con Son or Con Dao Island being the largest. The total area is 76 km²
and it is 185 km from Vung Tau City and 230 km from Ho Chi Minh City.  
The peaceful and pristine beauty of Con Dao allows one to avoid the noise,
pollution and bustle of modern life. The cool breeze and fresh air make one
feel relaxed. The atmosphere is ideal for walking or riding a bicycle or
scooter to explore the mysterious island. The town is so calm and quiet as
your roll along next to mossy fences, old houses, old French villas and
historical relics, down the long and winding road along the blue sea, with
big, ancient trees casting their shade in the street. Do not forget to go to
Con Son Market to discover local culture and enjoy local specialities.  
Splendid beaches: It is difficult to pull out yourself away from the crystal-
clear sea while admiring the spectacular paintings of white sandy beach,
mountains, sky and lush forest. If you are feeling lazy, you can spend the day
sunbathing and swimming or enjoying the five-star services of a wide range of
beautiful resorts. However, if you get on the large road and turn to a rough
track, it will surprise you. Find the way to Dam Trau Beach, located outside
the Con Dao National Park, or cross over the forestâ€™s trail to Ong Dung
Beach or Suoi Nong Beach. These are considered pristine beaches which have yet
to be discovered by many tourists.  
Snorkelling and discovering corals: Do not forget to try snorkelling to see
schools of fish swimming around colourful coral reefs.  
Fishing: Book a fishing tour on the immense blue sea. Fishing at day, or squid
fishing at night and enjoy delicious seafood.  
Con Dao National Park: The Park is one of 2,203 wetlands of international
importance and the first marine Ramsar in Vietnam. The parkâ€™s total area is
nearly 20,000 ha, consisting of 6,000 ha of terrestrial and 14,000 ha of
marine habitat. It is home to 144 species of animals and 1,321 species of sea
creatures, including 37 species listed in the Vietnam Red Data Book. The park
is an ideal place for those who love climbing, trekking, discovering nature
and sightseeing. It is an interesting experience when encountering animals in
the forest, rare orchids, huge old trees and pristine beaches.

**Historical Pilgrimage  
** Con Dao Prison: Awarded the title of Special National Relic in 2013, the
prison system here was the largest prison in Vietnam. Con Dao Prison was
established in 1862 and lasted until Reunion Day, 1975. French colonists ruled
Con Dao for 92 years (1862-1954). Then, they handed over Con Dao Prison to
Saigon in 1955. It includes many prisons, labour basements and tiger cages.
Thousands of patriotic and communist soldiers were tortured until 1970, when
this â€˜hell on earthâ€™ was revealed and shocked the world with its gruesome
tortures. More than 40 years have passed since the reunion day, but its
atmosphere is still blanketed by a dull colour of painful memories.  
Hang Duong Cemetery: Built in 1992 and covers 20ha. This is the largest
cemetery in Con Dao, where thousands of prisoners were buried. Among 1,913
graves in the cemetery are 793 which have specific names and addresses. The
rest are anonymous. Hang Duong Cemetery is always crowded with visitors. Many
of them come to the cemetery to pay tribute to the heroine Vo Thi Sauâ€™s
grave, the youngest prisoner under death sentence at Con Dao. Making a visit
to the cemetery at night is the frequent activity of local people. It is
believed that midnight is the moment that the living and the dead can be
connected through the mind.

_Now there are three boats cruising from Cat Lo Port, Vung Tau City to Ben Dam
Port, Con Dao Island. Boats CD09 (VND150,000) and CD10 (VND200,000) depart
from 5 p.m. and arrive at Con Dao Island about 6 a.m. in the next day and vice
versa. Boat CQ-03 (VND390,000 a seat and VND590,000 a bed) departs from 8 a.m.
and arrives at Con Dao Island at 4 p.m. and vice versa.  
Working with many partners and supporters, **International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN)** implements a large and diverse portfolio of
conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the
traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse
habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve peopleâ€™s well-being. Since
2014, Vietnam-based IUCN has been running a Marine turtle Conservation
Volunteer Programme in Con Dao National Park, Nui Chua National Park in Ninh
Thuan Province and Hon Cau Marine Protected Area in Binh Thuan Province to
raise communityâ€™s awareness of marine turtle conservation._

**Turtle tours:** Con Dao is the home of sea turtle. There are 17 beaches that
have reported sea turtles hatching. Several large spawning areas include the
sand flats on Bay Canh, Hon Cau, Hon Tai and Hon Tre Islands. The sea turtle
nesting season in Vietnam lasts from April to October. It is an emotional
experience to stay overnight to watch the turtle mothers giving birth and gain
new awareness of sea turtle protection specifically and environment protection
in general.

**A bit of Africa in Vietnam  
**

Last month, I had a fantastic tour to Phu Quoc Island with my parents and
colleagues. The Vinpearl Safari was on our mustâ€“visit plan. And it was
really an unforgettable experience.  
We arrived at the area at around 8am. As soon as we got off buses and headed
to the entrance, the sound of drums boomed. I saw a troupe of black men and
women dancing and singing, welcoming our group. The drums stirred up the mood
of the visitors. Many of them, including old people, showed the appreciation
and couldnâ€™t keep from swaying and dancing with the performers.  
I had heard praise and criticism about Vinpearl Safari and wished to go there
to see it. The nature and animals living in the wild are not something one can
see easily, except on TV. And I imagine it must be tremendous work and effort
to open and develop such a park on the island. What I saw, I would recommend,
especially if you have little kids.  
Our group was riding the trolley touring the park, through and by the
inhabited areas of the animals. Then we went in special buses with glass
windows to go slowly, to see animals so close as if we could touch them. On
the bus, the tour guide provided lots of information about each type of
animalsâ€”their origin, their character, what they eat and how big they can be
and occasionally story of a special animal. It was lively inside the bus with
children shouting or commenting on a tiger or big lion so near, and people
taking photos.  
After visiting the areas of big animals, we attended the show with lots of
demonstrations of birdsâ€™ talents. The MC at this show is very active and
appealing. Her closing show about bow birds knowing how to collect waste
quickly to keep the environment clean was very good. The message about love of
nature and care for our environment was strong and penetrating.  
This is Vietnamâ€™s first Safari Park, where animals live and are taken care
of in a relatively natural way, Vinpearl Safari on Phu Quoc Island has rare
animals and diverse botanical systems from many different geo-ecological
regions.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/_DSC6756.jpg)

Located in the Long Beach area on the Phu Quocâ€™s west shore, Vinpearl Safari
houses over 2000 animals, belonging to more than 150 rare and precious species
from all over the world.In this model, the living space of Vinpearl Safari
citizens is surrounded by moats filled with water, which imitate the harmony
of their natural habitat.Exotic animals such as Bengali tigers, Arabian
oryxes, addaxes, Madagascar lemurs, red flamingos, scarlet macaws, rhinos,
giraffes, bison, iguanas, and ball pythons really feel at home here.  
There are theme zones such as the Peacock Garden, Egret Garden, Starling
Garden, and especially the elegant Red Flamingo Lake, that make the open zoo
experience so remarkable. Visitors can mingle with lovely wild life in such a
relaxed way.  
Occupying a large area with diverse botanical content, each part of the
Vinpearl Safari recreates a different ecosystem, suitable for the biological
habits of each member species. Sitting in a reinforced bus, visitors can see
lions, rhinos and zebras close-up, through a glass window. Being so close to
lions playing on dry grass, watching a group of giraffes leisurely crossing
the path, a rhino family enjoying a mud puddle while some drinking waterbucks
nearby suddenly startle at the sound of a tiger thunderously roaring…all is so
unforgettable.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/_DSC5103.jpg)

Vinpearl Safari also offers many unique action-packed entertainment options,
such as seeing daily animal shows, taking photographs with cute and friendly
animals, or taking part in a dance of the Zulu, the largest ethnic group of
South Africa.  
Mr Tho, our tour guide told us â€œComing from South Africa, the Zulu dance
troop intended to stay only 10 days. But the beauty of Phu Quoc Vinpearl
Safari has held them for nearly a year nowâ€. Wild and vigorous , the Zulu
dances never failed to clear all boundaries and distances to drag visitors
into a whirlpool of boiling emotions and movements.  
After nearly a year in operation, Phu Quoc Vinpearl Safari â€”Vietnamâ€™s
first semi-wild parkâ€” has become a second home for animals from all over the
world, and it has begun to receive their descendants. With the care of
Vinpearl Safari vets and staff, not only the Bengali tigers but also many
other rare and precious animals have successfully reproduced here.  
Vinpearl Safari is a gift for those who love travelling and exploring nature
and wildlife. It has been a destination of choice for many domestic and
foreign tourists to the beautiful Phu Quoc Island.â€

Elegantly standing on the fragrant frangipani-ornated Nguyen Hue Boulevard,
splendid fiveâ€“star Rex hotel has been an essential element in HCMCâ€™s
golden collection of iconic hotels, setting standards for luxury and
hospitality with charming flair and distinct character in the southern capital
nearly for a century.  
It strikes its guests with a unique mix of history, colonial architecture,
noble elegance and thrilling ambience of mystery. Its large columned lobby in
light brown, gray and champagne marble housing an atmospheric coffee lounge,
shopping arcade and reception area boast an old world noble elegance with the
charming traits of art deco.  
The labyrinths of carpeted corridors with framed black and white pictures of
old Saigon, antique side wall lamps and liveried porters bring to mind
Christieâ€™s Orient Express decorations. Varnished wooden doors lead into the
hotelâ€™s fancy accommodations, ranging from Deluxe and Premium up to colonial
chic Governorâ€™s and Imperial suites in the Executive Wing. The rooms
interiors, in dark chocolate and champagne, feature fine custom furniture in
noble colonial style, shiny parquet floors, mellow light from beautiful lamps
and sconÑes, altogether creating a ceremonious yet festive, cosy and
intriguing atmosphere, and also a space of fine comfort and chic in which to
indulge oneself.  
The Executive Wing overlooks the spectacular and lush vertical gardens, which
are really surprising to find along the five-floor-high walls of the spacious
courtyard, serving a beautiful, open-air patio cafe by day and turning into
Golden Lotus open air in-house theatre by night with colorful Vietnam cultural
heritage shows put on stage nightly.  
The Rexâ€™s Golden Lotus Theatre, with one-of-a-kind interiors which are
actually all exteriors to experience in the very heart of the Southern
metropolis amid the verdant tropical greenery under the starry sky with
spectators seating placed on the elevation of the large balcony, is definitely
a venue not to be missed. With such aesthetics, the Rex Hotel deserves, if not
an Audience Choice award, then sincere applause for its non-trivial concepts
and creative approach. But the show is truly impressive, representing a
colorful, meaningful and enticing insight into Vietnamese traditional arts,
engaging masterly Vietnamese court dance, traditional mystical operetta
originally performed by mediums from Northern Vietnam, a stone musical
instruments performance from the highlands, spectacular dance of lanterns
invented over 300 years ago in Hue, and 11 sketches of Vietnamâ€™s national
water puppet performance in a 50 minute show. The show is accompanied by a
team of traditional music players and singers, which brings to mind a curious
association with silent cinema era.  
The live music night in Rex Hotel could be continued after the fall of the
theatre curtain in the historic rooftop bar which got famous during the
Vietnam War, when it served as a meeting point of military officials and war
correspondents and later was recognized as one of the best bars of SE Asia by
Newsweek magazine.  
One day would be barely enough to visit all of the in-house facilities, which
include two rooftop swimming pools with striking city views, two thematic
restaurants full of character and boasting sumptuous and sophisticated
interiors of Vietnamese court, offering almost unlimited options to widen
oneâ€™s gastroâ€“outlook, an Executive lounge with elegant interior dÃ©cor and
a charming view of vertical gardens. The Rex Health Club with spa center that
has such a range of intriguing spa packages titles on the menu such as Ancient
Vietnamese, Four Hands Therapeutic, and Candle Journey massages along with
constant attractive promotions for in-house guests, promises hours of
relaxation and rejuvenation after the hectic days of exploring the numerous
city sights. The key city sights, including Saigon Notre Dame Basilica,
Municipal Theatre, War Remnants Museum and Ben Thanh Market are all in walking
vicinity from the hotel.  
With its long history, distinct noble elegance and an insight into rich and
colorful Vietnamese culture, Rex Hotel offers its guests an excellent chance
to see another Saigon, elegant and aristocratic, which stands behind the
curtain of a modern and hectic SE Asian metropolis.

**  
Can you feel as relaxed as you do when watching a good movie or sipping
aromatic tea while listening to hypnotizing musicâ€¦while youâ€™re having your
hair done? The answer is, â€˜Itâ€™s absolutely possibleâ€™ at Reagan Beauty
Salon (20 Hang Tre St., Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi).  
**

Located on a busy street in an elegant atmosphere, Reagan Beauty Salon, an
advocate of customerâ€™s ultimate satisfaction, is dubbed by many â€˜a garden
for the soul.â€™ The beauty services include hair styling, skin care, spa and
makeup by stylists Reagan (Hong Jong Won) and You Kyung. This South Korean
couple has over 20 years of experience and has worked with famous actors and
actresses and K Pop idols.  
A talented stylist with keen eye for beauty, Reagan shared his thoughts, â€˜I
think one should dedicate everything to all the details in oneâ€™s work,
especially in the field of beautifying peopleâ€™s look. To achieve perfection,
a salon has to be able to combine 3 elements: product, technical skills and
service quality.â€™  
Thatâ€™s why all Reagan Beauty Salon customers find it irresistible, distinct,
uniquely charming and classy, always promoting moral and humane values which
are the powerful, all penetrating message of Hallyu (a South Korean cultural
wave). For example, the salon staff has to practice hair washing with their
fingertips for two months and pass a test. Only then are they allowed to
service the customers. All technical services such as cutting, styling,
curling, uncurling, restoring, steaming and dyeing are performed by Reagan or
You Kyung directly.  
Asked about the salonâ€™s service principles and unique style, Mr. Reagan was
very direct, â€˜I love Vietnam and Vietnamese people. To be able to work and
contribute here is a blessing. So I want to introduce Vietnamese customers to
modern salon model of South Korea. In any working environment, the human
factor is central. Therefore, before getting trained, my staff must be
oriented. They must answer three questions, â€˜Do you want to work at a
hairstyle salon?â€™ â€˜Why?â€™ and â€˜For what purpose: passion, hobby,
ability, or money?â€™ Next, I help them plan firm steps for the future, teach
them moral principles, and then train every one of them in technical skills.  
Every hair has its own life cycle, and each customer her own personality.
Without precise notice of them, a hairstylist can bring about â€˜disasterâ€™.
So at Reagan Beauty Salon a trainee should apply hair cure products at least 2
months before moving up to next level. During probation, they have to learn
all the rules and manners, from greeting customers, serving tea, to informing
customers about anything about to be done, smiling and thanking them. It is
both the discipline and the culture of the salon that everyone has to learn
and observe before learning anything technical.  
With great passion for hair beauty, Reagan has sleepless nights too, â€˜I
worry about hazardous chemicals in hair cure cosmetics. Many establishments
carelessly do hair for pregnant and breast feeding women. Reagan Beauty Salon
always refuses to service them, and explains to them that some cosmetic hair
cures, organic though they may be, still contain chemicals which can soak
through the scalp, enter the blood stream and affect the fetus or the baby.â€™

**A quick interview with Reagan the stylist & CEO**

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Standee_1_Reagan-Profile2.jpg)

_**Where does Reagan Beauty Salon place itself in the mind of its customers?  
**_ We focus on 3 points that make the distinction: 1. Customer service must
be the first priority. Customerâ€™s relaxation is not yet adequately
prioritized at other salons in Vietnam. 2. All the staff must be highly
professional to make the customers feel comfortable and at ease. 3. The salon
only receives 10 first-booked clients every day in order to make sure they get
the best possible service and care and feel that itâ€™s worth their money.
Using only 100% organic products (extracted from natural products and imported
directly from South Korea or Japan) and having over 20 years of experience, I
am confident to bring the best hair service of South Korea to Vietnamese
customers.

**Whatâ€™s your next plan in mind as a successful professional stylist and CEO
of Reagan Beauty Salon?**  
Reagan Beauty Salon is where I come true my goal to beautify Vietnamese women
and uprear Vietnamese professional hairstylist in technique and aesthetics.
Weâ€™re in discussion with top-notch colleges in Korea over hair & beauty
academy, which, I believe, will make a key role in disseminating the essence
of Korean beauty in Vietnam.

My friends were jealous of my luck when I got the chance to put my footprint
on Japan, one of the most beautiful countries in the world. I had a six-day
trip to Japan at the invitation of Kinki Tourism Ministry/Kansai International
Airport/Tobu Group to Vietnam Heritage. Beginning when the plane landed at the
airport and I got my immigration stamp, I began to fall in love with Japan,
and my love only grew as I admired the breathtaking city view from the
mountains, went to majestic castles with large, beautiful gardens, worshipped
in the sacred ancient temples, took the long and winding road climbing to the
mountains, enjoyed Japanese specialties in hundred-year-old houses and walked
on pavements decorated with blossom trees.  
I came into Kansai International Airport in Osaka Bay, â€˜One of 25 of
mankindâ€™s greatest engineering achievements,â€™ according to CNN. A 70-year-
old official instructed me how to fill in the customs form. He was very gentle
and kind. I wonder why he still worked at that age. I saw old workers
everywhere. A Japanese friend told me that in Japan many old people want to do
a job after retiring. I think that labour not only helps the old earn a
living, but also make them feel useful. Maybe that is the reason why most
Japanese have longevity. According to research by the United Nations, in 2015,
Japan had the highest proportion of working seniors among developed countries
including US, Canada, UK, Germany, Italy and France.  
I admired mouth-watering, hand-made plastic food displayed in the glass
windows of all restaurants. They looked so real in both detail and colour.
They were invented by Japanese nearly a hundred years ago. The food models are
used as a menu with a small sign, ingredients and price of a dish in English
and Japanese. It is convenient for foreigners to know what they are getting
eat before they order.  
There was a variety of tourist information in English at the airport or you
can ask the staff at the information desk at the airport. It will be their
pleasure to instruct you where, when and how for your trip in a short or long
stay. I took a 131-page tourist book for travelling in the Kansai regions and
I wished I could go to every place from the first page to the last page. My
advice is you should not spend time on many places instead of focusing on some
in a day. Because in every place you will learn a lot of information about
history and tradition; template the landscape and taking photos. You should
buy â€˜One Pass Ticketâ€™ at $30 to use at train stations. The network of
train stations are built densely through the country.  
Kansai regions, South-Central Japan, include Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Fukui, Shiga,
Mie, Nara, Wakayama, Tokushima and Tottori. Among them, Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe
are crowded with tourists. It was August and Japan welcomed me with the
sunâ€™s hot rays of summer. Each season in Japan has its own attractions and
is no exception for the summer which is perfect for outdoor activities,
festivals and sparkling firework performances on the night sky.

**OSAKA**

**Osaka â€“ Mitsui Shopping Park  
** The smooth highway road, with a backdrop of calm, blue sea and endless
mountains spanning the airport and the main land, is so idyllic. I visited a
famous destination in Osaka â€“ Mitsui Shopping Park which had over 200 of the
stores and restaurants. The mall was an interesting place with many famed
local and foreign brands. Most of stores and restaurants in Japan open after
11 a.m. and close around 8 p.m. It is a full-day trip for families to go
shopping, play, learn and discover.  
Nifrel, located in the entertainment area of Mitsui Shopping Park, is
considered a living museum featuring an aquarium and zoo. Under innumerable
lights and surrounded by glass, the hall looks like an endless space in the
ocean. Colourful sea creatures swam peacefully. Every species had its own
territory in a small glass pond. After taking a walk in the ocean, I entered
the jungle. Everyone said â€˜Ohhâ€™ and â€˜Ahhâ€™ when a big majestic white
tiger grabbed his toy. Opposite the tiger was a crocodile using his tiny eyes
to observe tourists as though we were the ones in the zoo. Tourists are
advised not to feed or birds or squirrels. Besides this, the tourists are not
allowed to use cameras with flash, so as to protect the animals from
discomfort. Two penguins kissed and cuddled, ignoring other touristsâ€™ looks.
Next, I went into a room with dim light. It was a light installation art
bringing a mysterious world with various scenes from nature and the galaxy.
The children took a shower of lights with joy.  
_**How to get there:** 2 minutes walk from Osaka Monorail Banpaku-kinenkouen
Station_

**Abeno Harukas  
** Next, I came to the tallest skyscraper in Japan, â€˜Abeno Harukasâ€™ with a
height of 300m, including a commercial centre, a museum, a hotel, an
observatory from the 58th to 60th floor and a subway station in the basement.
From there, I had a birdâ€™s-eye view of Osaka. It was so amazing. I feasted
my eyes on the sea of buildings stretching to the mountains in the horizon. I
felt like an infant who was able to stand up for the first time after a period
of crawling. With the combination of â€˜earthquake- resistant technologyâ€™
and â€˜vibration control technologyâ€™, Abeno Harukas was secure against
earthquakes measuring up to 7 in seismic intensity. In addition, Abeno Harukas
is designed in a harmonious relationship between the earth and â€˜citiesâ€™.
The building is supplied with power generated from the buildingâ€™s kitchen
waste. This system creates heat and electricity by converting the waste into
methane gas. Open spaces incorporate throughout the entire building to create
channels for natural sunlight and fresh air to travel the interior.  
_**How to get there:** 5 minutes walk from JR Tennouji Station_

**Crab dishes  
** Osaka is the third largest city, so it is easy to be lost in the crowded
streets with two rows of restaurants, hotels and shops. Joining the crowd I
found my way to Kami Doraku, a famous crab restaurant in Osaka. It was not
difficult to recognize the restaurant with a huge crab hanging in the front of
it. The restaurant served a range of crab traditional multi-course lunches and
dinners. My belly was fulfilled with a feast of crab, including boiled crab,
steamed egg custard with crab, gratin crab, deep fried crab, crab sushi, soup
and fruit. They are so fresh, cool and delicious. The prices ranged from $52
for a set menu dinner. Crab, unagi (eels), fugu (bufferfish) and Kobe beef are
luxury dishes in Japan.

**KOBE**

After a long day I had a good night at Hotel Okura Kobe overlooking Kobe Port.
My room offered a picturesque view of calm sea, Kobe Port Tower, a big wheel
and the city brightened by millions of colorful lights. Next early morning I
could not take my eyes in the window. The city looked like a pretty woman
sleeping in peace. A new day with many interesting things in Kobe were waiting
for me to discover.

**Kobe Shushinkan Breweries  
** It is such an interesting experience to taste sake at the popular Kobe
Shushinkan Breweries, established in 1751, in the Nada region of Kobe.
Japanese crafted this legendary liquor 2,000 years ago. A 10-minute
documentary film is shown to explain to tourists how to make its premium sake
called Fukuju. Locally grown rice, naturally pure water from mountain streams
and cold winds blowing down from the mountains create the perfect condition
for the fermentation process and handcrafting techniques help create amazing
flavour. At breweries, you usually see a sugitama, a ball made of cedar
leaves. A fresh green sugitama is hung on the doorsteps of the breweries to
notify people that a new batch of sake has been made. On the back label of
sake, there are numbers with and â€“ sign showing the amount of sugar in the
sake. A negative number means itâ€™s sweet, and positive number means itâ€™s
dry. Chilled liquor touched my tongue and went through my throat with a little
bitter, which made my mind refreshed on a hot afternoon.  
How to get there: 10 minutes walk from Hanshin Ishiyagawa Station

**Kobe Beef  
** Kobe City is the namesake of beef which is the finest in the world. It is
said that cows drink beer, are massaged with rice wine and listen to classical
music to get the quality meat and give the meat a marbled appearance. Is that
true? I do not know. However, one thing absolutely right is the meat very
fresh, tender and juicy. It was â€˜melt-in-my-mouthâ€™ as soon as the first
bite. The secret involves its origin. Tajima-gyu is regarded as the pinnacle
of even the Japanese Black domestic breeds of Wagyu cattle, of which only a
few now exist. No cow comes into this world and begins its life as Kobe beef.
Even among Tajima-gyu cows, only the chosen few that satisfy specific quality
criteria deserve the title â€˜Kobe Beefâ€™. So, the price is so expensive
around $1,000 for a kilogram.

**Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens  
** A cable car brought me to Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens, which is located on a
mountain with the height of 397m. I feasted my eyes on a lush of trees, white
water from a waterfall, a green dam and a splendid city view. The air was
fragrant with natural aromas. The flowers boasted colourful beauty in the rays
of the sun. The trees were full of fruits. The gardens were so clean and tidy;
herb garden, rose garden, fragrant garden, lavender garden, four- season
garden, oriental garden, lily garden and fruit garden. Some tourists relaxed
their feet in the herbal footbath while enjoying the outstanding landscape. I
walked along lovely curving paths to go down the mountain. Taking a break on
the bench and looking to an open space of sky, mountains and the city by the
sea make me feel freedom. The closer with nature the more you earlier get
balance in life. I wonder why Japan usually suffers the anger of Mother Nature
every year .Time seemingly can heal every wound but Japan recovers quickly in
surprising of the world. It is a strong country of samurai warriors.  
_**How to get there:** 5 minutes walk from Kobe Municipal Railway Shin-kobe
Station_

Mud bath at the Binh Chau Hot Springs.

If you are planning a weekend getaway from the bustle of cities to a serene
place where you can enjoy lush trees, the murmur of streams and loquacious
sounds of birds, or bury your legs in soft sand on beautiful beaches with
crystal water or just display your tanned skin and splendid pictures, then
Binh Chau Commune, Xuyen Moc District, Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, 140km from Ho
Chi Minh City, is an ideal destination.

**Walking on a pristine beach**  
Binh Chau Commune, 20km from Phuoc Buu Town, has a 12km shoreline, flat
sandbank and gentle waves convenient for swimming.  
Ho Tram and Ho Coc are beautiful and pristine beaches in Binh Chau Commune
with crystal water and white, soft sands. Ho Coc is away about 5km from Ho
Tram. There are many impressive rocks with many shapes scattered or flocking
together on the beach of Ho Coc. Taking a walk on the beach, inhaling a deep
breath of fresh air, feeling the sea flavour in the wind and enjoying a
picturesque sunset, I restored balance in my noisy and tired life.  
Do not forget to go to the Binh Chau Market to buy some seafood for dinner by
the beach. You will have an unforgettable memory with delicious food,
murmuring waves and a myriad of stars in the night sky.

**The Binh Chau-Phuoc Buu Nature Reserve – A green lung in the South-eastern
region of Vietnam  
** Although it is very difficult to pull out yourself away from the pristine
beach, you should change your slippers for sport shoes for an adventure
discovering the Binh Chau-Phuoc Buu Nature Reserve.  
The Binh Chau-Phuoc Buu Nature Reserve, formerly Binh Chau-Phuoc Buu Protected
Forest, was established in 1978. In 1986, it was placed on the list of
Special-Use Forests in Vietnam with the aim of conserving nature, heritage
relics and the genes of forest creatures, researching science and serving
ecotourism.  
Binh Chau-Phuoc Buu is one of the few areas along the coastline of Vietnam to
retain a significant cover of natural forest. It has total area of 11,293ha.
The natural forest is predominantly deciduous. The nature reserve supports 49
species of mammal, 106 species of birds, 38 species of reptiles and 12 species
of amphibians. These include several globally threatened and near-threatened
species, such as Bear Macaque (Macaca arctoides), Siamese Fireback (Lophura
diardi) and Pale-capped Pigeon (Columba punicea). There are 732 plant species,
including 114 rare ones.

The nature reserve contains three areas of low hills: the Hong Nhung group
(which reaches 118 m) in the north, the Ho Linh group (which reaches 162 m) in
the south, and the Mo Ong group (which reaches 120 m) in the west. There are
43 km of rivers, lakes and streams, some of which some have water all year
round.  
Challenge yourself with walking trails through the forest, rowing a boat,
crossing streams and climbing the mountains. Standing on the top, you will be
treated to the tranquil scenery.

**The Binh Chau Hot Springs – Medical Tourism**  
The highlight of the nature reserve is the Binh Chau Hot Springs, surrounded
by the lush of Melaleuca trees. Binh Chauâ€™s hot springs have earned
recognition as one of 65 potential areas for sustainable eco-tourism
development among 47 countries worldwide. It has a total area of 7 ha and has
70 visible thermal springs in the area, forming a huge hot pot with valuable
water and sedimentary mud, which are believed good for health recovery and
skin. After a 15-minute soaking in hot springs and a 45-minute mud bath, you
will own a lively body and a soft skin.  
Located in the primeval forest with a spectacular landscape and valuable
resources, the Binh Chau Hot Springs attracts a number of local and
international tourists. A Japanese visitor said that: â€˜This is the first
time I came here. My family loves this tourist site. The splendid views remind
me of onsen, hot spring, in Japan where I usually come after work to relax and
meet my friends. My kids like to cover their bodies with dark mud and scamper
everywhere. It is an interesting experience.â€™ Moreover, a Russian told me
that: â€˜This is not the first time I travelled to Vietnam. The first time I
was in Mui Ne and Phan Thiet. This time, we chose here because of the hot
mineral water source. This is a suitable place to rest and refresh the mind
and body. It is very cold in Russia. So, it is good for my children to travel
to a destination which has warm sunlight. My wife can soak in hot springs and
enjoy spa services. Also, the view is so beautiful.â€™  
You will be starving after rolling in the mud and bathing in warm water. So
you can enjoy the eggs boiling in hot wells with the temperature of 82oC,
while you admire the view in vapours from hot lakes bubbling and the backdrop
of green Melaleuca trees.  
What are you waiting for? Bring necessary items such as sun glasses, swim
suits and sport shoes to come Binh Chau for swimming on the beach, discovering
the forest and relaxing in hot springs.

Whilst I could not claim Binh Thuan Province as a home away from home, I
certainly have had a strong attachment to it for the past sixteen years.
Firstly, my sister-in-law has a farm there. She grows dragon fruit, which
could be a symbol of Binh Thuan. As a family, we often spend time there and I
go fishing in a small lake with my brother-in-law. I would highly recommend a
home-stay break in Binh Thuan. It will give far more local insight than just
meeting paid-to-smile staff at a hotel and the people here are the salt of the
earth. Also, I often go to Mui Ne to report for this magazine. Let me give you
an overview of what this area has to offer while recommending the hotel I
stayed at on my last two visits.  
That stretch of beach before Mui Ne fishing village has come a long way since
I first visited in 2000. There was but a single hotel in those days. Now it is
synonymous with a Vietnamese beach holiday. Yet the artisanal picturesque
fishing fleet is still seen out on the bay and people still tend their land.
Tourism has diversified the economy; not dominated it. If you want a more
secluded beach, the beaches south of Phan Thiet offer a wild romantic coast
and there is plenty of excellent accommodation these days. You can visit Ke Ga
headland with its lighthouse. Also, do not forget that the city itself has a
public beach, the pine tree park in front of which has recently been upgraded.  
But for some, relaxing on a beach or lazing by a pool can get boring. Never
fear; this province has plenty of interesting excursions and places to visit.
The area around Phan Thiet was the last part of the Indianised Kingdom of
Champa to retain its independence. To get a taste of its history, visit the Po
Shanu Towers, which have a romantic legend attached to them. You may be lucky
enough to witness a Cham festival here. Failing that, your hotel should be
able to arrange a visit to a Cham village. Cham culture is still alive and the
people still speak their own language and use their own writing system. I
myself have visited a Cham weaving centre and enjoyed Cham live music and
dancing there.  
For Buddhism, a jungle experience and spectacular views across the countryside
and out to the coast take the cable car at Ta Cu mountain. On top is a temple
complex with what was, until recent years, Vietnam’s biggest reclining Buddha.
I would advise walking one way by a jungle path. There are resting places
along the way, although it should take you little more than an hour. There are
good restaurants both at the top and at the bottom.  
For the more adventurous, try the Phu Quy Islands. These are famed for their
historical cultural relics, beaches, untouched landscapes and succulent
seafood.  
I bring you news of a forthcoming permanent attraction in  
Mui Ne. â€˜The Forgotten Land, Sand Sculpture Parkâ€™ is due to open in Phan
Thiet on 29 January 2017. This will be themed around legends of both
Vietnamese and Western culture. Sculptors Enguerrand David and Leonardo
Ugolini praised the fineness of the Mui Ne sands and their variation in
colours.  
Most famous of all are the Sand Dunes. The red ones are near Mui Ne and I have
stayed at the Sandunes Beach Resort & Spa. The white ones are around ten
kilometres further down the road. On my recent trip, I was advised by the
receptionist to visit the red dunes at dusk.

_Photos: Sandunes Beach Resort & Spa_

As I climbed up the dunes, a farmer was driving his cows back home. It is
popular for both l  
ocals and visitors to come out here at sunset. Children were having fun
sliding down the dunes on mats. There was a great view of both Mui Ne and the
smaller Hon Rom bays with the little island of Hon Lao just off the headland
that separates them.  
This trip, I stayed at the Sandunes Beach Resort & Spa. The gardens had grown
since I last stayed here, attracting bird life such as a rufous breasted long
black-tailed drongo. On the private beach, the sandpipers were still there,
darting in and out of the waves breaking to shore. In the gardens, I enjoyed a
long relaxing bath in the three-tiered swimming pool. Last time, I was in a
villa. This time, I had an elegant room on the third floor of the main block.
This is because it provided a coin of vantage for viewing day break. Once
again, the sun hid behind a cloud. Had it been free, I know it would have
shone a golden road over the waves for half an hour. Nevertheless, I enjoyed
the tangerine skyline and the sea shimmered in the half-light like a satin
mantle. It set me up for an excellent buffet breakfast provided at the hotel’s
airy Parakites Restaurant.  
As I have said, there is more to Binh Thuan Province than beaches. The
authorities of this province have had the vision to keep the resorts mainly
low-rise and help to promote local initiatives providing â€˜Forgotten Landâ€™,
with a disused stadium for its exhibition. I hope you will be able to sample
some of the charms of the place as I have over the years. The Sandunes Beach
Resort & Spa is a great place to base due to its facilities, its oneness with
nature and proximity to the dunes.  
Forgotten Land – sand sculpture park is at National Sport Training Centre

Ke Ga Lighthouse, Binh Thuan Province, 2014  
 _Photo: Pham Trung Kien_

**Two travellers conquer an old lighthouse on a desolate island**

With an area of just 7 ha and only 500m from shore, Ke Ga, a beautiful rocky
island in Thuan Qui Commune, Ham Thuan Nam District of Binh Thuan Province is
quite famous because it has a lighthouse that many think is the tallest and
oldest in South-East Asia.  
Recently, many tourist companies came up with attractive ideas by combining
the lighthouse tour with extreme games such as raft rowing, rope skidding, and
asphalt-coated bamboo basket rowing from the shore out to the island.  
From Ho Chi Minh City, I and a friend who didnâ€™t like taking tours decided
to go to East bus terminal to take a bus to Phan Thiet. In this tourist town,
we easily got a motorbike for VND150,000/day and hit the road to Ke Ga. Just
30km from Phan Thiet, we saw the lighthouse, which looked like Don Quixoteâ€™s
lone proud pike.  
On the shore opposite Ke Ga, in the shade of densely planted coconut trees, we
saw a lot of restaurants and inns that offer boat transportation to the
island. Seeing new strangers, a boat owner immediately offered, â€˜Please take
my boat. Itâ€™s just VND50,000 for a round trip.â€™  
About 10 minutes later, we were on Ke Ga Island. Itâ€™s made of rocks of
different sizes and shapes. Thick flocks of swallows float in the sky like
huge kites.  
Today, the island today is barely covered by rare dry bushes, but historical
records say that Ke Ga had a small creek running through a dense forest, rich
with pheasants.  
Two rows of age-old big rough-barked plumeria trees line the path to the
lighthouse. â€˜Each row has 20 trees, planted by the French over 100 years
ago. They blossom garishly from Jan to April, and that is a sight to seeâ€™,
the lighthouse keeper told us. The tower base is an octagon; each side wall is
3m long and 1.6m thick, built with thousands of large granite rocks,
laboriously cut. I felt like an ant standing next to an elephant.  
According to the Southern Maritime Safety Company, which takes care of Ke Ga
lighthouse, its height is 41m from the base.  
Pointing to a little shrine blurred in incense smoke, the lighthouse keeper
said, â€˜Itâ€™s for the 90 souls who died while building this lighthouse.â€™
He added, about 40 years after having colonized Vietnam, seeing that many
ships and junks sank in the area around Ke Ga, the French decided to build
this lighthouse. Designed by architect Chnavat, the lighthouse construction
began in February 1897 and finished in late 1898.  
Inside, 184 spiraling stairs, worn flat by human feet, lit by numerous windows
on the side walls, led to the top of the tower. Just half way I sweated
profusely, my heart pounding in my ears.  
At the top, I was surprised to see for the first time a light bulb nearly 1m
in diameter. It uses solar power, can turn 360 degrees and can be seen from 22
miles away.  
Walking on the balcony around the light bulb, called the â€˜eye of the seaâ€™,
I felt dizzy at the depths below, and the infinite blue misty mass of the sea
and the sky. Beneath me, wave after wave lathered the rocks around the island.
The houses of the fishing village Ke Ga gleamed behind the dock full of
fishing boats and lush dragon fruit gardens.  
As we returned to earth, we entered a two-storey house with almost meter-thick
walls, built by the French for the lighthouse keepers, and listened as its
current masters shared their stories about the happiness and sorrows of living
on the island, protecting the â€˜eye of the sea.â€™

From the East bus terminal there are many buses go the Phan Thiet route with
ticket prices ranging from VND12,000 â€“ VND150,000.  
In Phan Thiet, from 5.30 a.m. to 6 p.m, every 30 minutes bus no. 6 takes
passengers to Ke Ga village.  
Along the shore opposite of Ke Ga Island there are tens of resorts with room
rates ranging from VND800,000 to VND1,000,000/double room/night.

** From a small village on Dinh river bank, Ba Riaâ€“Vung Tau became a
flourishing city. The first Viet settlers came, 3-4 century ago, to break this
ground. Once the communities were stabilized, they built the first village
temple: Temple Phuoc Le. The over 200-year-old temple is the place to worship
many cultural dignitaries.  
Tablets of 158 local heroes and martyrs are also worshipped here. In the
courtyard are the two shrines of the Lady of the Five Elements and the Lady
Water Dragon. Every year, the Phuoc Le Temple hosts 6 big events, full of
folklore rituals.

**The Round House  
** Ba Ria-Vung Tau has also preserved quite a number of dwellings featuring
traditional architecture, which are 70 to 100 years old. After being colonised
by the French, the Oriental and Occidental cultural elements have merged in a
delicate and unique way, most clearly visible in the residential architecture.
These historical monuments mark stages of continuous development of Ba Ria.  
The Round House of Ba Ria is a famous, iconic historical monument of this
town. Casting silhouettes on the blue sky, this water tower was once the
tallest structure in town.

**Statue of Jesus Christ**  
Looking from the sea at the Little Mount, one canâ€™t help being overwhelmed
by the imposing religious edifice on its top: the Statue of Jesus Christ. The
road to the top of Tao Phung to contemplate this grandiose work of art is
challenging, but also very appealing to most of tourists who visit Vung Tau.  
The mount is surrounded by peaceful natural greenery. Up a few dozen steps are
the praying hall and a souvenir shop run by the monastery of the Congregation
of the Holy Cross Lovers, with small statues of saints and colourful
handicraft items. Along the 800 stairs leading to the Lordâ€™s statue there
are many sculptures depicting episodes from the Bible. Plumeria flowers evenly
lining the stairs from the bottom to the top seem to purify visitorsâ€™ soul
before coming to contemplate the vision of the Lord. From this height, one can
see the Nghinh Phong (Facing the Wind) cape, bright in the sun and wind of
Vung Tau Sea.  
The hilltop where the Christâ€™s statue stands is 136 m from the sea level.
The statue is 31m tall, his arm span is 18.4 m wide. The statue is standing on
top of a square house. This statue of the Lord Christ is an art work of
engineer Nguyen Quang Duc (concrete engineering) and artist Van Nhan (artistic
aspects).

Statue of Jesus Christ

Around the statue there are 3 cannon, the remainder of the 11 great cannons of
the old Vung Tau defence formation, built by the French at the end of 19th
century. Visiting Christâ€™s statue, one can go inside the monument and climb
133 spiral stairs that lead to his arm. From the Lordâ€™s arm, your eyes can
capture heaven and earth, land and water, sun and wind of this country.  
This is the best place to view trading routs at sea with many ships and junks
criss-crossing and the panorama of the rich and beautiful city of Vung Tau.
Day after day, at the Vung Tau trading port, ships and junks go in and out in
great numbers, full of fish, cargo and tourists, showing hectic rhythm of life
of a sea port.

**Bach Dinh (The White Palace)  
** Built in 1898 at 27m above sea level on Big Hill in Vung Tau, The White
Palace is the name of the summer hideaway of the Governor General of Indo-
China. Today it is a national historical heritage site. Hidden in a small
grove, the 3-storey, 19m tall building, once used by the French to confine the
patriotic King Thanh Thai, later became a holiday retreat of King Bao Dai and
presidents of the Republic of Vietnam.  
Today, the White Palace remains almost intact and holds many precious antiques
such as the Royal Sofa set, a pair of 170cm long African elephant tusks, a set
of Happiness â€“ Fortune â€“ Longevity statues in 5 generation enamel, and
eight half-length sculptures in ancient Greek style. It is now used as a
museum exhibiting archaeological finds, antique ceramics and cannons.

**Long Son Big House  
** Long Son Big House is an architectural complex consisting of a temple, an
auditorium, a school, a museum and a cemetery, all built on a 2ha area at the
foot of Bamboo Hill in Long Son Commune, Vung Tau City. This is a National
historical and cultural heritage site. The Big House was built by Mr Le Van
Muu from 1910 to 1929. Mr Muu was normally seen bare-chested and bare footed,
working all day, his long hair bunned behind his head, hence the nickname Sir
Tran (â€˜tranâ€™ means bare-chested.)  
Besides building the Big House, Sir Tran collected many kinds of furniture
such as altars, table sets, and lacquered boards of wisdom from all over
Vietnam. While building the Big House, Sir Tran instructed the locals to live
simply, honestly, observing high moral values. After his death in 1935, his
descendants began to worship him in the Big House, which since then is also
called Sir Tran Temple.  
Well preserved through the ups and downs of history, Sir Tran Temple and the
antiques he collected attract a lot of tourists especially on the Double Nine
day (the 9th of the ninth lunar month) and Sir Tranâ€™s death anniversary (the
20th of the second lunar month.)

**The Grave of Ba Ria (Lady Ria)  
** An old laterite grave in Tam Phuoc Commune, Long Dien District, the resting
place of Lady Nguyen Thi Ria, the pioneer who broke fresh ground of the vast
area of mountains and forests of Ba Riaâ€“Vung Tau Province today. After her
death, all of her lands were given to the poor. The grave was very modest at
first. In 1902 Lâ€™Ecole FranÃ§aise dâ€™ExtrÃªme-Orient of Indo-China rebuilt
her grave with laterite, adding a stele which read â€˜Revered Lady Nguyen Thi
Riaâ€™.  
In 2010, Long Dien District Peopleâ€™s Committee built a shrine beside Lady
Riaâ€™s grave. Every year on the 4th day of the 4th lunar month, the district
commemorates her deeds and legacy to educate younger generations.

**Vung Tau Lighthouse  
** Vietnamâ€™s first lighthouse, built in 1870 at 170m above sea level on
Little Hill. In 1913, the lighthouse was rebuilt on the same spot, retaining
its original design.  
Today, the 18m tall lighthouse is still working, and is very important for sea
traffic. Although the bulb is only 500W, its light can be seen from 55km away
due to enormous prisms.

_

**_Within just three km2, there are two national cultural relics, a famous
beach with pebbles of seven different colours, and a temple for those who
perished in a bloodcurdling massacre 60 years ago. A day scouring on foot the
tiny piece of land packed with heritage in Binh Thanh Commune, Tuy Phong
District, Binh Thuan Province seemed as long as years.  
_**

**Seven-coloured beach**  
Leaving the inn early in the morning, we came to a shop that sold the typical
cang cake of Tuy Phong. The shop keeper was filling and changing the red hot
cake moulds in the oven at dizzying speed. The shop was so crowded that we had
to leave, missing a chance to enjoy a mouth wetting, VND20,000 local
breakfast.  
A few hundred steps further, we came to the beach, thick with shops that sold
food and beverages, all crowded with tourists in a good mood.  
Behind the beach, the famous seven-coloured pebble field looked like a levee
built with pebbles. The â€˜leveeâ€™ was over one kilometre long. Scientists
say that this 250,000 m3 pebble field was formed by an irregular sea current
that pushed the pebbles here from the bottom of the ocean.  
The waves continuously lapped on the levee and then receded. Over thousands of
years, this made them sleek and shiny under the sun.  
Unable to resist the temptation, we removed our shoes to walk on those gems.
The touch, the sounds and the air made the foot massage feel magical.  
After the seven-coloured pebble field, we came to a rugged rock formation
which was green as if painted. I have been told that this phenomenon happens
only during the months of February-March, attracting a lot of photographers.

**Pagoda in a cave  
** About 500 metres from the seven-coloured field, we came to Co Thach Pagoda,
the most sacred pagoda of Binh Thuan Province and a national cultural heritage
site.  
This is actually a complex of an old and a new pagoda besides the one in a
cave, with many Buddha statues standing on big rocks scatted around the five
ha premises of rugged terrain edging the sea.  
It took quite a lot of sweat to see everything in Co Thach. We had to not only
go up and down the rocks, but also worm ourselves through rock slits and creep
into pitch dark caves.  
The oldest building here is a small pagoda built 150 years ago under the shade
of age-old trees, surrounded by enormous rocks stacking on one another. The
space between these rocks form caverns, each houses a Buddha statue and is
always incensed. The locals call such caverns â€˜Cave pagodasâ€™, and there
were many of them on this hill.  
The website of Vietnam Buddhist Church describes the founding of this first
â€˜cave pagodaâ€™ as follows: â€˜In the mid-19th century, Zen priest Bao Tang
chose a rock cave at Co Thach to be his place of meditation. Admiring the
monkâ€™s spiritual achievements, Mr Ho Cong Diem built for him a spacious
pagoda and named it Co Thach. Since then, Co Thach pagoda has gone through
four generations of venerable head priests and multiple renovations…â€™

**The 300-year-old communal house**  
That noon, after a modest VND25,000 lunch, we took a one kilometre walk to
Binh An Villageâ€™s communal house, recognized by the government as a
â€˜national heritage of artistic architectureâ€™.  
The house has the blue sea at the front, the fishing village at its back, a
dock with hundreds of anchored fishing boats on the right and a white sand
beach on the left.  
The main structure of the house is a group of three interconnected, mostly
wooden buildings, which are the Main Sanctuary, the Middle House, and the
Kowtow Hall, having an area of 300m2 in total. Culturologists say that this
house is a â€œnice mixture of palace and folklore architectureâ€, which is
used to worship deities and national heroes.  
All pillars, beams, purlins and walls of these buildings are meticulously cut,
carved and polished. The portal of the Main Sanctuary bears intricate relieves
of the sacred animals: a dragon, a unicorn, a tortoise and a phoenix; a
conifer and a reindeer representing long-lasting fortune; apricot blossom
representing wealth; and cranes as symbols of longevity.  
Inside the house of Binh An, there are tens of altars of different sizes, all
beautifully carved, and precious antique utensils such as bells, thuribles,
weapons, drums, wooden bells, a great bell, and silk conferment letters of the
Nguyen Kings.  
The whole 1,500m² premises is fortified by a strong one metre thick and 2.5
metres high wall. The main gate is three metres high, 2 metres wide beneath a
gate sign that reads â€˜Gate to the marvelâ€™. It is adorned with â€˜two
dragons competing for a gemâ€™ statues; Lord Silk Fiber holding the Sun and
Lunar Lady holding the Moon statues representing the harmony of Ying and Yang…

**The story of a horrific massacre**  
That afternoon, when the blaze of the land called a â€˜little sand desertâ€™
was subdued, we took a 2.5 kilometre walk from the communal house and came to
the memorial of the massacre that shook the world 60 years ago.  
The inscription at the memorial read, â€˜Morning, February 20, 1951 (a full
moon day of first lunar month), a French regiment marched into Cat Bay Village
and opened fire, killing 311 villagers, burning hundreds of houses and raping
many women.â€™

_  
After burning incense and praying for the hundreds of innocent souls, we
entered Cat Bay, a poor and peaceful village beside the memorial. Some people
here still remember the tragic scenes and events that took place â€˜That
morning my family was having cassava for breakfast. Suddenly, we saw a lot of
legionaries surrounding the village. A group of soldiers came to our house and
shouted, â€œEveryone out!â€ 12 members of our family held each other inside,
trembling from fear. They immediately opened machine gun fire and burned the
house. I was 16 at the time, and was holding a little brother behind a bag of
rice, and thatâ€™s why we survived,â€™ recalled an 80-year-old man named Thoi.

**_Three cultures have left their mark on this  
heritage site, and the world is richer for it_**

Phu Quy is an island district of Binh Thuan Province, a habitat of prehistoric
people that has wells, graves, shrines and pagodas, with traces of Sa Huynh,
Cham, Vietnamese and Chinese civilizations intertwined. It also has beautiful
sceneries, peaceful beaches and fearsome rock faces.  
Phu Quy District consists of 10 islands with total area of 17.82km2, 56
nautical miles to the east-southeast from Phan Thiet. The population is about
27,500, concentrated on 16.5 km2 Phu Quy, the biggest island of the 10.  
The only way to come to Phu Quy is by boat from Phan Thiet harbour. It takes a
high-speed vessel about 3 hours to reach the island.  
Having found intact stone tools on Phu Quy Island, Vietnamese archaeologists
have confirmed that Sa Huynh civilization did spread to this island in the
middle of the sea 3000 years ago.  
Sa Huynh, one of the oldest and most prosperous civilizations of Vietnam,
existed from 1,000 BC to the 2nd century AD.  
Four graves and Five wells dated from 13th century, almost intact, and folk
legends led the culturologists to conclude that the next masters of Phu Quy
were the Cham of Champa Kingdom, which ruled the Southern part of Mid-Vietnam
from 192 to 1832.  
The customs, rituals and other ancient religious edifices such as temples,
pagodas etc., which were undamaged but weathered by time are proofs that later
on, the Viet and Chinese people came here, mingled in harmony with the Cham,
creating a cultural mixture unique to Phu Quy.  
According to the district Peopleâ€™s Committee, Phu Quy has over 30 vestige
sites, most notably the Princess Ban Tranh (daughter of a Champa King) shrine,
built in the late 15th Century, Master Sai Nai (a Chinese) Temple, built in
late 17th century, Linh Son Pagoda, built on a 80m height in 1747, and Thanh
Lam Pagoda, built in late 18th century.

Linh Quang Pagoda on Phu Quy Island, Binh Thuan Province  
 _Photo: Do Huu Tuan_

The most special relic on Phu Quy is Linh Quang Pagoda, one of the oldest
pagodas of Binh Thuan Province, built in 1747. Sitting on a solemn hill of My
Khe Village, Tam Thanh Commune, Linh Quang Pagoda was recognized by the
government as a National Cultural Heritage in 1996. It contains many antique
items such as Buddha statues, drums, bells, and most notably, many royal
decrees of conferment.  
The second relic frequently mentioned by tourist-explorers is the An Thanh
Temple, recognized by the government as a National Cultural Heritage in 1996.
Built in 1781 on a white sand beach of Trieu Duong village, Tam Thanh Commune
to worship the whales, it houses nearly 100 skeletons of whales and
leatherback sea turtles. Adhering to Viet traditional architecture, the
templeâ€™s structures include the main edifice, ancestral shrine, and martial
spirit shrine.  
Most visitors praise and locals are proud of the beautiful sceneries of the
district such as Cave Fall Beach, the Masterâ€™s Grave, Tranh Island, and Bird
(Hai) Island. But what I love best is to stand on the slopes or top of the
hills and contemplate the tiny colourful human existence amongst the vastness
of the sky and the sea.  
Perhaps the best place to see and feel it all is the 85m high top of Cao Cat
Hill. From this hilltop, one can see also old shrines and temples, now
appearing, now hiding behind the canopy and dense dwelling structures of
populated areas.  
The hill is by itself an attractive site to see with spiraling stairs, and
rocky promontories and caverns. At the height of 80m is the time-weathered
Linh Son Pagoda, and an impressive statue of Avalokitesvara stands
majestically on the hilltop. These elements combine so organically, as if to
demonstrate the sacredness of the wild nature.  
After a reenergizing hike around you may want to cool down on the wide beach
with fine white sand of Trieu Duong bay beside a singing poplar grove.  
Adventure lovers wonâ€™t miss a chance to explore the other islands around Phu
Quy. The most interesting one is Hon Tranh, the second biggest island of the
district, which is just 0.6km2 and a 15 minute boat ride from Phu Quy. Itâ€™s
also a habitat for chameleons, sea snakes, rock lizards, flat crabs and
egrets. Rocky promontories and white sand beaches line the island. There is a
shrine for a hero who saved King Nguyen Anh. The people on Hon Tranh are all
marine soldiers ready to share their stories about the sea and to help those
in need.

Every day there are two round boat trips between Phan Thiet and Phu Quy. The
departure time depends on the weather so make sure to ask the harbor services
at (062) 3506-358 (Phan Thiet) and (062) 3506-374 (Phu Quy) before going.  
On Phu Quy, there are inns and home-stays for rent at about
VND200,000-VND250,000/double room/night, such as Hoang Phu Inn, 500m from the
harbour, tel: (062) 3709-550; Truong Huy inn, Vo Van Kiet St, My Khe Village,
Tam Thanh Commune, tel: (062) 3769-333. Most of them have motorcycles for hire
at VND100,000/day. There are also many restaurants for visitors to choose.

The inspiring idea that the quote â€˜long is the journey to an exotic tropical
island retreatâ€™ does fail sometimes comes to mind immediately as I draw a
balcony curtain aside at my elegant Deluxe Ocean View Room at Vinpearl Halong
Bay Resort, 7 storeys above the emerald waters of Halong Bay. The dreamy and
splendid panorama of limestone mountains coated in the mist floating above the
water forming the fanciful incised underline to the horizon at oneâ€™s full
view is hypnotizing. Minutes ago, I was transferred at a blink of an eye from
the mainland snowy white check-in building with exterior of a small castle and
noble-looking interiors of concert hall in classic style with columns and
elegant furniture to the private Reu Island, lying 200 metres from the land.  
Bright new five-star Vinpearl Halong Bay Resort exclusively located on its own
private island with the total area of 40,000 m² and opened to guests seven
months ago looks truly impressive with its noble neo-classical architectural
style and grandiose crescent shape silhouette, embracing the sunlit island
terrain.  
The half-minute long electric car ride from the pier made and a beautiful
fountain of water running down the stairs at the entrance passed, one steps in
the huge hall of the reception area with interiors, furnishing, lighting and
carpets made in the best traditions of sumptuous art deco style, featuring
chic sitting areas crowned with dramatic ceiling fittings, foyer lounge bar
with piano, flowing smoothly in to the Bay view restaurant with floor-to-
ceiling panoramic windows and running further both sides along the carpeted
ways to the elevators leading to two wings of luxurious accommodation.  
Resort premises observed from above strike with aesthetic outlay featuring
expansive open-air rose garden, gradually descending to two outdoor swimming
pools, one of which comprises 1.025m² of blue water placed over the huge and
blossoming exotic flowers sophisticatedly â€˜plantedâ€™ on their bottom from
deep blue ceramic mosaic pieces. The pool is placed steps away from the front
sandy beach overlooking the bay. The island seems to have a sea star shape
featuring three natural sandy beaches with calm waters and gradual descent
from shallow to deep, inviting one to enjoy at least two daysâ€™ long swim
with one of the best sea views Northern Vietnam can offer as the back drop.  
The luxurious accommodation of Vinpearl Halong Bay Resort features 384 rooms,
ranging from Deluxe Ocean View and Deluxe Pool and Terrace through Panoramic
and Executive suites up to two chic Presidential suites with fabulous 350m²
area and 360 degree views over stunning Halong bay.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/HL1.jpg)

All the rooms boast noble-looking interiors in fine art deco style with
exquisite furniture in decorative curlings, king beds, sophisticated lamps and
lightning fittings, cosy long chairs and spacious terrace-like balconies with
a view one is never tired of. Due to the unique location, the striking views
of the bay can be enjoyed from all of the resort rooms. The corridors and
passages in beige, champagne and gold colours with beautiful carpets and chic
lamps, are turned into landscape painting galleries showcasing the peaceful
images of European rural idyll of the 19th century.  
Among indoor exquisite facilities are all-seasons swimming pool (the third on
the premises)with ornamental round windows overlooking the sea, state-of-the-
art fitness centre and chic Vincharm spa with extensive menu of exotic
treatments, including unlimited relaxation package with two spa treatments for
a person per day, Vincharm signature coconut silky wrap, green tea scrub and
Thai massage. The resort also has a huge indoor kids club and outdoor playing
ground to impress its small guests, two tennis courts and water sport
activities centre to cater to sporty holiday makers.  
The gastronomic side of a stay in Vinpearl Halong Bay Resort deserves sincere
hats off compliment for its quality, variety and creative way of serving in
three impressive in-house restaurants. The â€˜on spot gastronomic cruiseâ€™-
all day dining buffets served in Bay view Restaurant is included in the stay
at the resort and features nearly a hundred dishes each, embracing Vietnamese
authentic cuisine, fresh seafood galore, Japanese rolls and sashimi and an
Italian food corner. The colourful full board that very few guests would
manage to resist or treat with moderation represents the signature treat of
the Vinpearl Resort chain and is truly unique both to the eye and to the
palate. It boasts a bright palette of Vietnamese specialties like exotic rice-
cake delights from Hue, the ancient capital, famous for its high cuisine and
traditional New Year rice pie banh chung, which causes a strong addiction in
those who catch the zest of its taste. Not to mention the baked and grilled
fish, various seafood, excellent pho soups, many sorts of cheese and tropical
fruits on display.  
An expansive a la carte menu is also waiting to be explored at the elegant
interiors of Akoya Restaurant and stunning Pavilion dining venue built on
water with panoramic bay view sand tailored for a memorable, romantic and
atmospheric dining out.  
The elegant Pearl Lounge with live music from a Filipino band in the evening
apart from cocktails galore and powerful Vietnamese coffee selection
hypnotized me during my two day-long stay with one of the most tasty-looking
club sandwiches and salmon burgers Iâ€˜ve ever seen on display, but remained a
dream to me as their degustation was impossible to undertake due to the busy
schedule of full board indulgence.  
With a large number of rooms within the Vinpearl Halong Bay Resort premises
and its full occupancy, the space there somehow surprisingly gives a feeling
of privacy and tranquillity and together with the highly professional
performance of its personnel gives an impression of staying in a boutique
hotel with personal approach to its guests but not of a stay in a large-scale
hotel institution housing hundreds of people.  
With its unique location, impressive yet harmonious architecture, excellent
gastronomy, an array of activities and facilities meant for total relaxation
and indulgence, as well as a wide range of exclusive tours to remember on
offer including day and sunset private cruises, cave dining, cable car trips
over the bay to recreational parc and sea plane trips , Vinpearl Halong Bay
Resort seems to turn their ambitious logo â€˜being the holiday paradiseâ€™ in
to action with success and earns one of the leading titles in the list of the
best and newest resorts of Northern Vietnam.

The driver got out of the car to inspect the snake we had just run over. He
poked it with a stick to be sure it was dead, and then put it in a plastic bag
at my feet. â€˜It will make a nice addition to lunch,â€™ he said. I wondered
what the rest of the menu included.  
We were driving over the mountains of Phu Quoc Island off the south western
coast of Vietnam. Fifty percent of the island is covered by mountains and
virgin forest. The island is ripe for development, with resorts springing up
quickly near the towns. But this is the place to come for unspoiled mountain
views, empty beaches and life with no deadlines. We wanted to avoid the
tourist traps and littered beaches near the towns and see the island on our
own terms with one of the local teachers as guide.  
Most of the northern island has been declared a national park. Our driver
stopped near the entrance and bought a bag of baby clams cooked in their
shells. We sat on a rock in the middle of a stream and enjoyed our snack. It
was October, the temperature was perfect, and we had the forest almost to
ourselves.  
Later, some friends met us with motorbikes and took us down a long forest
trail with small houses secluded among the trees. Time slowed as we rode
through an older and simpler world. Coming out at the bottom onto a clean
white beach, we ate at one of the open-air restaurants that only the locals
know. A fisherman with his nets and coracle smiled and invited me to take some
photos. Vietnamese people love fresh seafood and beer, and we spent a couple
of hours indulging in both. I was the only foreigner there.

Two marks of man on the island we felt we should visit. The first was the
prison where the French, and later the Americans and South Vietnamese, held
prisoners during the wars. The reconstructed tin sheds are full of life-size
mannequins showing how prisoners lived. Sadly, the prison was known for its
brutal tortures, and the life-like figures of caged men in the hot sun were
reminders that man himself is sometimes the snake in the Garden of Eden.

If the prison was depressing, the second site was inspiring. We drove between
the mountains and the sea and stopped at the gate to Ho Quoc Pagoda, the
Buddhist temple perched high on a hill. We climbed the long stairs between
writhing dragons frozen in stone. The mountains behind the temple seemed
eternal, but the pristine beach and open sea below looked newly created, as if
yet untouched by man. Two monks set out incense and disappeared. My friend
offered incense and prayers, handed me some incense sticks and went outside. I
was alone in the temple. The sound of a muted gong added a touch of mystery to
the serenity.  
The next day we drove along the coast, enjoying the quiet sea and beaches
framed by palm trees. We stopped at one of the pearl farms near Duong Dong,
the district seat. A guide explained the process of â€˜farmingâ€™ cultured
pearls and the long showroom was filled with cases of pearl jewellery of all
varieties and prices.  
Our next stop was the Son Phat winery. We walked among the rose myrtle bushes,
and then tasted the slightly sweet wine made from their fruit. It reminded me
of black currant wine, but lighter in taste and colour with a nice bouquet. At
about five dollars a bottle, I bought some as parting gifts and some to take
home. When I declared the wine at the airport, it was sealed and allowed on
the plane.  
It was a weekend well spent, and I was back in Ho Chi Minh City by Sunday
night. For those with more time to spend, there are adventures on and under
the water as well. The best times to go are in April-May or September-October.
Flights to and from Ho Chi Minh City last about fifty-five minutes and cost
around $70 per person each way. Or, visit Rach Gia on the mainland coast and
take a ferry from there (you will pay a little extra for a seat on deck).  
You can book a double room at one of the small hotels for $15 to $30 a night
and avoid the expensive same-sameness of the resorts on Long Street. We were
privileged to be with friends who live on the island, but you can have the
same friendly personal service with Jerry and his guides at Jerryâ€™s Jungle
Tours. Book early for an off-the-trail, on-the-water, or under-the-water
custom adventure. Plan to go soon.

Mu Cang Chai District in Yen Bai Province is about 300km from Hanoi, with an
average height of 1,000m above sea level, mostly mountainous, cut by deep
gorges. The average steepness of slopes is 30o, but sometimes itâ€™s over 45o.
The tallest peak, Lung Cung, is 2,963m high.  
But unlike other rugged regions, Mu Cang Chaiâ€™s hill slopes look like they
are covered with scales. Terraced paddies form stairs for giants to walk up to
heaven. According to official data, Mu Cang Chai currently has 2,500ha of
terraced fields.  
To most domestic and foreign tourists, these terraced fields are not only the
most grand site of the Northwest, but also one of the most unique and
spectacular attractions of Vietnam. The special thing about these masterpieces
is that they were made by the sweat of many generations.  
About 500ha of terraced fields in La Pan Tan, Che Cu Nha and De Xu Phinh
communes of Mu Cang Chai have been ranked National Touristsâ€™ Attractions by
the government of Vietnam.  
The terraces, though always proud and humble through times and weathers, look
best from mid-September to October, when they are covered in golden ripening
rice under the mild sun of autumn.  
From May to June, Mu Cang Chai wet terraces shine like a glass mosaic
reflecting the colours of heaven and mountains.  
Generations of Hmong and many other tribes have worked their hearts out to
level each stair, build the edges with rocks, cut trees and make irrgation
pipes, and to transform the terain into a work of art.  
Even the local customs and festive activities are all related to the terrace
paddy lifestyle. In recent years, local authorities have been promoting this
cultural heritage by organizing a â€˜Week of Tourism and Culture of Mu Cang
Chai Terraced Fieldsâ€™ in mid-September. On this occasion, domestic and
foreign visitors have a chance to not only comtemplate the glory of the
stairways to heaven, but also to take part in cultural events rich of local
and ethnic content, such as highland fairs, a sticky cake making contest,
Hmong pipe contest, and goat fights.  
Apart from the terraces and festivals, Mu Cang Chai also has many other
attractions to be discovered, such as Pung Luong peak, a rock sculpture field
in Lao Chai commune, Che Tao pristine forest, the triple cascades of Dream
Falls in Mo De Commune, hot springs and caves at Nam Khat, and the age-old tea
forest of La Pan Tan, Notably, in recent years, tourist companies have offered
also paragliding service at Khau Pha Pass for those who want to see the
terraces from above.

—————————————- __

  * To go from Hanoi to Mu Cang Chai, adventurers can use a motorbike, and comfort lovers can use bus service at My Dinh terminal. In Mu Cang Chai township, there are dozens of inns where a double bed room costs about VND150,000 â€“ VND200,000. The inns also have motorbikes for hire.

If you are flying to Nha Trang seaside resort city, make sure to ask for a
window seat, as the plane flies along the vast and sunlit southern coastline,
low enough to see the waves crashing against the shore. The approach for the
landing offers one of the most impressive sea views to contemplate in Vietnam-
over the sparkling Nha Trang Bay with huge emerald green beading necklaces of
verdant islands and islets, all set in goldcast by bright rays of tropical sun
falling on the sands through shallow water.  
The highway from the airport to brand new Cam Ranh Riviera Beach Resort &
Sparaces neck and neck with cheerful white and velvet rows of blooming
bougainvillaea, grown to serve a median strip from one side and the blue
continuum of the Pacific from the other. After aquick shuttle bus ride, Cam
Ranh Riviera Beach Resort & Spaâ€™s main building appears at oneâ€˜s view,
looking impressive yet from a distance with its contemporary and light
architecture. Its smooth and flowing lines reminds one of a luxurious sea
cruise liner anchored on the sandy shore. The amusing feeling of boarding a
cruise liner gets stronger once one enters a spacious lobby, with no doors and
windows but all opened to the breeze and overlooking the vast and
uninterrupted spaces of the sea.  
As I get to my Deluxe Sea View room with a full board ticket in hand and step
out on the airy balcony with transparent glass sides I almost believe I m
actually contemplating the blue of the Pacific Ocean from a 8-floor-high ship
deck. The main building examined from the seafront side impresses with
excellent architectsâ€™ design featuring light curves of balcony lines,
imitating waves and smooth and pleasant-to-the-eye combinations of snowy white
colour and cooling glass of the balconies. All these features reveal an
excellent work by the architect, not as often seen in Vietnam as desired. Far
below are 10 hectares of Riviera resort premises with spectacular layout of
infinity pool, huge blossoming lotus pond and a seafront pool with villas and
bungalows with private pools under the shadow of young and juicy green coconut
trees, all of them put on the green canvas of neatly kept lawns. Green lawns
are also grown on the curved roofs of snowy white villas to put them in
perfect harmony with floral surroundings.

The rooms interiors please the eye with modern and refreshing design, spacious
bathroom with glass wall, wooden floor and contemporary yet cosy furniture,
where it feels like the space is organised to put an accent to the immediate
proximity of the sea and its striking panorama at oneâ€™s full sight from all
the rooms without exception. The corridors and passages are built like whole-
floor-long balconies overlooking a striking panorama of the picturesque valley
with mountains at the backdrop.  
The resort area is truly expansive, with exquisite accommodations, featuring
226 rooms, ranging from elegant Deluxe Sea View rooms, studios and suites to
luxurious Beach Front and Ocean View villas, with all of them overlooking the
sea. To ensure the utter comfort and to provide memorable pleasures of the
guestsâ€™ pastime at such an impressive institution are two elegant
restaurants, a spa centre, modern gym with a state of the art equipment, beach
club and entertainment programs comprising open-air cinema sessions, live
music and entertaining programs for small guests.  
The 200-meter-wide private sandy beach which is a part of mesmerizingly
beautiful and yet relatively pristine beach in Nha Trang surroundings looks
sensational. With calm waters and gradual descent from shallow to deep, a swim
here turns into a pleasure worth treating oneâ€™s self to for one full day, at
least.  
The Riviera resort also offers rejuvenating sessions of early bird yoga and
later in the day Zumba and aquaerobics sessions under the guidance of a very
inspiring and enthusiastic lady coach.  
Cam Ranh Riviera Beach Resort & Spa has everything the most discerning
traveller may need for an excellent seaside retreat, starting from bright new
exquisite accommodation and facilities and direct access to the sea with
private beach that few hotels in Nha Trang can offer to the small details and
personal approach successfully performed by resort staff that make oneâ€™s
stay truly memorable.

The Huge potential tourism in Hue has yet to be utilized. Locals are expecting
a breakthrough to lift up the localityâ€™s key economic sector from lackluster
development.  
Earlier this month, Hue authorities decided to form a single department
specializing in tourism, in contrast to other provinces in the country, where
administration of culture, sports and tourism remains in one department. This
is said to facilitate the development of tourism in Hue, which has huge
potential, but has been less developed in decades compared with other areas.  
No locality in the country has as much potential as Hue does. It has scenic
landscapes and our programmes for beach trips, adventurous and exploring would
all find ideal conditions in Hue.  
Lang Co Bay, which is 60km to the southeast of the city centre, is listed
among the worldâ€™s most beautiful bays. The bay offers various pristine
beaches and peninsulas that are perfect for beach activities, seafood and long
vacations in resorts. Visitors can take convenient trips to Thuan An beach,
where cool breezes are always available during hot summer days.  
Hue is also home to the Southeast Asiaâ€™s biggest lagoon system, Tam Giang –
Cau Hai, which attracts visitors for its gorgeous sunrises and sunsets fresh
lagoon air and delicious seafood.  
The locality also boasts the untouched Bach Ma Mountain, 1444m above sea level
and offers diversified flora and fauna. For tourists in need of medical
rehabilitation, two mineral hot springs, My An and Thanh Tan, provide soothing
relief.  
Hue was the royal capital of the Vietnamese kingdom ruled by the Nguyen
Dynasty from 1802 to 1945. It was thus the place that gathered the best from
other regions of the country, from handicrafts to traditional foods. This
brings Hue more options for culture and craft village tourism, with
destinations including the ancient villages of Kim Long and Phuoc Tich, and
traditional craft villages like bamboo-weaving Bao La, paper flower-making
Thanh Tien, conical hat-making Chuon, paper portrait- printing Sinh, and
bronze-casting Phuong Duc.  
All of these features make Hue a place to enjoy old values and local rituals
and customs, Home to nearly 300 pagodas and a great number of temples and
ritual platforms, Hue is also a pilgrimage destination for religious tourism.  
Hue has two Champa temples located in two rural sites, Lieu Coc and Phu Dien.
According to the late researcher Ho Tan Phan, Hue has a layer of culture more
profound than that of the prominent heritage left by the Nguyen dynasty. Many
pre-history artifacts have been found around Hue.  
Twenty-three years ago, UNESCO awarded Hueâ€™s heritage system the title of
world cultural heritage. The system includes the imperial citadel, kingâ€™s
monasteries, ancient bridges, canal and buildings, and royal temples. These
serve as the main base for Hue heritage tourism.  
In the heart of the city, Hue has iconic colonial buildings that are as nice
as those found in HCM City and the countryâ€™s villa town of Da Lat. Far away
from the city centre, many ethnic minorities on the mountains have a similar
look to northern peoples.

Last but not least, the locality holds the countryâ€™s finest cuisine, with
numerous food styles, from royal to grassroots. It also has its different
types of music listed as UNESCO and national intangible cultural heritage
items.  
Hue lacks only the cavern system that neighboring Quang Binh Province has to
become perfect in terms of potential. But tourism in Hue has developed poorly.
It is said to be a boring destination due to its poor products.  
Researcher Tran Duc Anh Son said once in a conference about promoting Hue
tourism that the typical locality like Hue needed tourism personnel that had
sound knowledge of Hue beside their management skills.  
To some extent, Hue lacks a strategic vision for tourism development. Local
authorities give almost no respect to cultural experts in exposing Hue
culture. Researcher Son suggested that the locality should set up criteria to
train qualified tourism staff.  
Moreover, Hue needs to improve itself with standard accommodation facilities
for research and entertainment activities.  
Another researcher, Nguyen Huu Thong, once said that Hue could live well with
what it owns and doesnâ€™t need any more added values to its profound culture
layers. The key is how to make use of the potential.  
Other researchers have encouraged local authorities to make more attempts in
improving cultural institutions at the locality by developing art performance
stages, cultural activity centres, cinemas and museums.  
Travel agencies running tour programmes in Hue have demanded an enhancement of
hospitality from locals and coherent management of tourism authorities.  
A variety of people from researchers to locals to people living in other
localities but with a deep love for Hue, know that strong efforts are needed
to make Hue a friendly destination, where visitors are eager to come, stay,
feel, smell, and spend.

surprised and stunned at the panoramic view of Hue from high in the air. The
last monarchic capital of Vietnam is uniquely elegant and meritorious as a
world cultural heritage.  
The people in eras gone by must have seen a vision of the nature when they
chose this middle valley of the Perfume River to build a wonderful capital.
Looking from above, one feels that the river and the city were destined for
one another. The city makes the river a poet that sings love songs to the
graceful streets and solemn royal structures.  
Looking from the upper reaches of the Perfume River, behind the colossal
Truong Son Mountains, the royal tombs of Nguyen Kings are half-hidden in the
lush greenery by the sides of riverâ€™s silk. Gia Long Tomb, simple and
grandiose, is surrounded by 36 hills. Few know that with its over 2800 ha
original plan, this is one of the largest imperial tombs in the world. On the
fork of Perfume River where its left and right tributaries meet, Minh Mang
Tomb is a masterpiece of harmonic and impressive architecture. Thieu Tri Tomb
is idyllic with lakes, pine groves, villages and paddies. On the other side of
the Panorama View Hill, Tu Duc, Dong Khanh and Kien Thai Vuong Tombs look like
gardens from fairy tales. Touching the river, the Hon Chen Palace, Temple of
Letter and Thien Mu Pagoda are culmination points of sophistication in
landscape accenting and design.  
From the Bang Lang fork down to the sea, the river flow becomes slow and soft,
curving around villages, fruit gardens, between moss-covered temples and
castle walls and a vibrant modern urban setting. The Royal castle stands right
on the waterâ€™s edge, surrounded by flowing water, thus making â€œfour tides
kowtow,â€ with the martial axis going straight through the center of the
Royal Citadel to the Magic Estrade, Letter Exhibition Tower, the Breeze
Exposure Pier and Ngu Binh Hill on the south bank. Worn for over 200 years of
rough weather and history, the walls designed to stand for eternity, the gold
plated and lacquered palaces, and the solemn temples and pagodas have remained
almost intact. Along the streets, modern-looking dwellings mingle with
residences of old noble families. They are miniature museums of traditional
architecture and aesthetics, where the unique typical Hue lifestyle is
vehemently preserved.  
Only from above one can see the whole harmonic picture of the old capital. The
wild mountains and forests in the West melt through the tombs, temples and
pagodas into the Royal citadel in the East, at the center of the valley, where
water flows meet and thriving energy runs high. In Vietnam, Hue is the only
old capital planned in such a harmony of Ying and Yang. It is meant to be the
land where both the living prosper and the spirits saturated, with the Perfume
River connecting the two worlds.  
Only seeing Hue from high above one can realize that the people of the old
were looking seaward. The distance from the capital to Thuan An estuary is
just 10 km along the widening Perfume River. The 60 km long, 1-4 km wide Tam
Giang lagoon is like a blue shawl lining the vast East Sea. This is where some
rivers stop and accumulate energy before pouring into a new cycle of life.
Thuan An and Tu Hien estuaries are the gateways from the countryâ€™s capital
to the big waterways, connecting it to international ports Hoi An and Da Nang.
These names have also been attached to many major historical events of the
nation through hundreds of years. It was in the times when Hue was the
countryâ€™s capital that Vietnam had definitely affirmed sovereignty over
Truong Sa and Hoang Sa archipelagos and a multitude of other islands along the
shore from the Gulf of Tonkin to the Gulf of Thailand.  
Only having seen Hue from high above one can understand completely the sung
words â€œHueâ€™s beauty can be found nowhere else…â€

In this watery land of Vietnam, every city has its associate river. Usually,
as is the case with both Saigon and Hanoi, the waterway is to one side, but in
Hue, it is crucially central. Whether a tourist, businessperson or simply a
native, you are bound to cross it on a daily basis. Having said that, I
normally visit but once a year, at Tet. Here is the story of my latest Tet
spent in the ancient capital. Largely, I visited old haunts, but there were
one or two new discoveries and I made a tour of the city’s four-star
accommodations, which may be of interest to those readers contemplating or
planning a visit  
Most who visit Hue see little more than the Purple Imperial Palace and the
Royal Mausoleums, but Hue is also one of the better cities to soak up a little
of traditional Vietnam. First, let me introduce you to our house, typical of
Hue. My wife’s family came to Hue as refugees from the North when the country
was split into two in 1954. They were allocated land on the edge of town. Over
the years, the family grew and her brother and sisters built houses around
them, making a family compound. Our house, based on concrete columns and a
tiled roof, is divided into three parts. First, there is the kitchen and
bathroom. Then, there is the central living area, a main feature of which is
the family shrine. Lastly, to the other side is the sleeping quarters. All
very simple, but quintessentially Vietnamese.  
Our street, which stretches for over a mile from the citadel, is very famous
among Vietnamese. We are proud of the name â€˜Chi Langâ€™, which commemorates
the Vietnamese victory over the Mongols (the only nation to achieve this).
Here also the mandarins from the Imperial Palace built their houses and their
temples. I seldom see a foreigner on our street, but it is worthy of a visit
if you are interested in pagodas and temples. Most of them are along the
roadside, but take care to see those down the alleyways as well. Take your
camera and you will be well-rewarded if you do visit ‘Chi Lang’. Do not forget
to try the local specialty ‘Me Xung’, sold in shops at the beginning of the
street. This is a sweet, like a sesame snap or a nougat bar.  
When my daughter became bored and tired of being harassed by her young
nephews, we decided it was time to visit a chic cafe. Rodo CafÃ©, by the new
road bridge, is housed in a kind of glass cabin. It is fairly new and its name
is akin to the Latin for â€˜wheelâ€™, and might derive from its location being
adjacent to the palace. It is on Tran Hung Dao Street, the boulevard that hugs
the river and which has some lovely gardens for a promenade. Although the flag
on the entrance tower to the palace is clearly seen nearby, there were no
tourists at Rodo on our visit. It is very popular with the Hue young set. It
is a bit like a home-grown Starbucks, as it serves exotic fruit teas,
including a range of Japanese matcha concoctions. It also serves light meals.
My daughter had a peach tea and a club sandwich, whilst I opted for an
American coffee.

4 gates of the Citadel. : Hoa Binh, Chuong Duc, Ngo Mon, Hien Nhon.

Afterwards, we wandered through a covered alleyway to a street that runs
parallel to Tran Hung Dao and for half a mile alongside the citadel moat. It
is a great place for taking a photo of the citadel walls and one of its gates.
You will not see many tourists in this hidden thoroughfare and the Hue Tourist
Board would not be proud of it, as it is quite possibly the poorest street I
have seen in Vietnam. We did, however, come across a lone elderly German
gentleman seated and enjoying a dish of water spinach cooked with garlic. I
asked him how it was. “Very healthy food”, he told me. I told him I
practically lived on the stuff, to which he responded, “That is why you look
so well.” Despite the poverty of the street, this was the third day of Tet and
there was a lovely festive air about it; every few metres outside there were
little gatherings of friends and all the houses had their front doors open,
revealing families enjoying themselves.  
As my brother intends to visit the ancient capital next year, I went to visit
Hue’s four-star hotels in order to choose one for him to book. If you are also
planning a trip to Hue, you should read on. There is currently an oversupply
of hotels in this category, resulting in perhaps the cheapest luxury rooms you
will find anywhere; from forty to sixty-five dollars per night, including full
buffet breakfast for two. They are all in the main hotel area with all the
facilities you will need; if you tire of hotel food there are Italian, Indian
and French restaurants nearby, as well as places to pick up a hamburger.  
All of the places I visited had great rooms, typically with white bed linen,
parquet flooring and dark tropical hardwood furnishings and with great views
of the river and citadel from the upper floors. Whilst I am not going to
recommend one above the pack, I can assure you none of them will disappoint
you. Five of them are tower blocks. ‘The Muong Thanh’ and the not-so-aptly
named ‘Midtown’ hotels have the clearest views. ‘The Moonshine’ could win the
best lobby prize and you might want the King Suite on the top floor for a
little under a hundred dollars a night. It even has its own private garden
with a little stone path. â€˜The Eldoraâ€™ is the newest and is beautifully
decorated in classical European style. It is further back than the others and
has only distant river views, but more than makes up for that with great
vistas of town, mountain and verdant rice fields. It has a magnificent top
floor indoor swimming pool.  
With the river lapping its premises is the ‘Huong Giangâ€™ I suggested to the
sales manageress adding the English translation-‘Perfume River’. This was
looking a little run-down when I last saw it, but since then, there has been a
brilliant refurbishing and this grand lady is looking now very attractive with
rattan furniture everywhere-even the reception area is adorned with the
material. This is the largest four-star and consists of three large blocks. It
was so popular that it was fully booked this Tet and all they could show me
was a suite.  
In short Hue with her beautiful river is more than history. With her excellent
affordable hostelries she is ráº¹juvenating.

11/20/2019,United we stand,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/united-we-stand/,,Pip de Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_0165.jpg,"We normally think of Asean- the Association of South EastAsian Nations-as a
weak federation. Certainly it is so compared to the EuropeanUnion. The latter
may have its problems, but at least it has achieved, ingeneral, the free flow
of goods and services and in large part, monetary union.Still, there are many
positive aspects of cooperation between the ten memberstates, and among them,
a highly competitive world trading bloc is evolving.Vietnam Heritage Magazine
is proud to have been involved in its Tourism Forum,the latest edition of
which took place in Manila in January, and in which ourEditor in Chief, Madame
Le Thanh Hai, took part as a delegate. We were therealong with giants such the
BBC and CNN, Trip Advisor and the various nationaland regional tourism Boards.

All the Asean countries have a multitude of delights tooffer for the tourist
dollar. Fine hot sunny weather and beaches is a top draw.Then there is the
warmth of the people, and discovering their customs, dancesand festivals. The
easy chance to enjoy delicious food and exotic fruits arealso high on the
list. Most countries have cooler mountain resorts, great rivertrips and
mysterious jungles to explore. Tourism gives a country an incentiveto conserve
nature, although, sadly, there have been failures to keep some ofthe animal
life of the region which people come to see. For the history buff,there are
intriguing ruins and ancient cities to explore. Actually, thesecountries have
just about it all, except perhaps for a skiing holiday, and eventhat could be
arranged at Singapore’s ‘Snow World’! The intense competitionbetween the Asean
nations can benefit the tourist. For example, Vietnam lastyear lifted visa
requirements for people from four key tourism markets.

**Country by country**

Let us begin with our home country, Vietnam. In the centralHighlands and the
Northern parts, rural landscapes and ethnic culture are themain attractions.
Sea tourism and culture are the lures, not surprisingly, incoastal areas. Ho
Chi Minh City and environs are tops for a city break and theM. I. C. E.
market. Finally, the Mekong Delta is favoured for its riveradventures.

The forum introduced the main travel events forthcoming inVietnam for 2016.
Firstly, from 14 until 17 April in Hanoi. â€œThe VietnamInternational Travel
Marketâ€ will take place. Then there will be the ‘HueFestival’ from April the
20th until May the 4th. In Danang from June 24-26, youcan see the’ Beach,
Leisure and M.I.C.E. Travel Mart’. Later in the year comes’The 12th
International Travel Exhibition’ in H C.M.C from 8-10 September andthe 5th
International Beach Games in Danang from 24th September until 2ndOctober. 2016
will also be ‘Visit the Mekong Delta and Phu Quoc Island’ year.

The Philippines was keen to promote two particular areas.Firstly, Bohol in the
central Visayan Islands got promotion for its scenery,especially the green
Chocolate Hills and its wildlife as the home of thecute-eyed Philippines
tarsier, one of the worldâ€™s smallest primates. Theopening of the new Panglao
Island International airport in 2017 will be ofspecial interest to the diving
community.

The tiny island state of Singapore provides a shiningexample of how to draw in
visitors even though you lack natural attractions. Ithas an open door policy,
with very few countries needing an entry visa. TheVietnamese in 2015 were in
the top ten visiting nationalities. As a large entryport, it has world-class
shopping and the ethnic diversity of its peopleensures a place as a culinary
mecca. Then there are its manmade attractions,such as the zoo with its
stupendous night safari and the innovative F1Singapore Grand Prix, to name but
two.

Another small country is oil-rich Brunei. It has beaches,jungle adventures and
the culture of five ethnic minorities on offer. However,it had only 200,000
foreign arrivals by air in 2014. It announced that the19-mile road bridge
linking the main part of the country across the sea to thedetached Temburong
district will open in mid-2016. As this is alreadyaccessible by a rather
scenic ferry ride or by road through Malaysian territoryit will bring little
benefit to the tourist.

The Malaysia presentation revealed some secrets for success.Firstly, it
advertises its wonders incessantly, as anyone who watches satelliteT.V. will
know. Then, it is extremely well-connected globally by air with eightyforeign
cities served directly. Communications are modern and well-developed.It offers
all the best that Asia has with great diversity of culture andattractions and
it is ‘Truly Asia’. Malaysia portrays itself as a safe andvalue for money
destination. I have visited several times and can testify thatall of this is
true. I have particularly fond memories of its hill stations ofFraser Hill and
the Genting Highlands and also the island of Penang for itshistory and nature
as well as its street food-ranked third in the world byVirtual Tourist.com.
There is news, too, of a proposed high-speed rail linkbetween Kuala Lumpur and
Singapore-the first in Asean.

Myanmar (Burma) in the past has been tough for the tourist.Firstly, visas were
hard to come by for anything but a short trip and then themilitary regime put
many of us off a visit. All that has changed with ‘Lonely Planet’ voting it
the world’s toptourist destination in 2014. The new government has prioritised
the developmentof the tourism industry. This large country with one hundred
and thirty threeethnic groups has great cultural diversity. There are
stupendous golden templecomplexes starting with Schwedagon in the capital
Yangon. There are amazingcave systems some housing ancient temples and idyllic
beaches on the westerncoastline. Myanmar even has snowcapped mountain ranges.

Another large country to explore is Indonesia with its 300ethnicities, 750
languages and dialects and 13 thousand islands. It has thefourth largest
population in the world. In the last few years a lot has beendone to make
entry into Indonesia easier. Asean countries and a few others aretotally free
and a further seventy five others can enter visa free for up toseventy five
days at certain airports and harbours. This has done a lot toenable it hit the
target of ten million visitors in 2015. The twenty-millionmark is hoped to be
reached within the next decade.

Thailand now attracts 29 million visitors a year. Thailandexcels in many areas
of hospitality from beaches to historical and religiousmonuments to
ecotourism, wildlife and scenery. It is also hot on cuisine (punintended). It
succeeds where some others are failing in getting repeatvisitors. Who does not
love Thailand? But Ms Kokarn Watttangrankul, governor ofthe Thai Tourism, had
some noble thoughts to share. “It is not just aboutfigures, building
friendship is more important”. “Her words reflectthe strong Thai commitment to
build peace and to connect the hearts and mindsof the Asean peoples commented
the website Travel Daily News Asia.

On to the neighbours and Cambodia, which styles itself asthe ‘Kingdom of
Wonder’. Not surprisingly, Vietnamese are the people who mostvisit here with
the Chinese a distant second. The two biggest draws are a citybreak in Phnom
Penh with its rich culture and architecture, vibrant nightlifeand shopping and
the must see major world heritage sites at Siem Reap, AngkorThom and Angkor
Wat. Then there are the beaches, marine tourism, the islandsthe mighty Mekong
River and eco-tourism, particularly in the North East.

Finally Laos, Asean’s most sparsely populated land. Justgetting away from the
madding crowd and being able to drive for miles with verylittle traffic
together with the peaceful and courteous nature of its very religiouspeople is
reason enough to come here. The Laotians they say do not grow rice,they listen
to it grow! Its tourism slogan too reflects the Lao value ofsimplicity.
Laconic, it sums up Laos in two honest words-‘Simply Beautiful’.With its
rivers and jungle Laos was keen at this conference to promote itseco-tourism.
It is rich in gilded temples too with visits to the UNESCO worldHeritage site
of Luang Prabang and the mysterious Plain of Jars being ‘mustdos’.

This meeting in Manila, then was a great opportunity for allthe players in the
industry to meet up and swap notes-all those involved in theindustry from
government officials to owners of hotels and travel companies aswell as the
travelling public in general. It was also an excellent time to showthe
strength and co-operative spirit of the ten Asean countries and to
showcasetheir attractiveness, beauty and positive aspects to the world in
general.

11/20/2019,The valley that captures hearts,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/the-valley-that-captures-hearts/,,Photos by Nguyen Phung Chi; Text by Le Ha ,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57 001.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57 002.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57 003.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57 004.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57 005.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57 007.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57 006.jpg,"![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57%20001.jpg)

Bac Son is a 6,979km2 mountainous district of Lang SonProvince, where
archeologists have found traces of Neolithic settlements of theancient Viet
people.

The province records show that Bac Son has 13 nationalvestige sites, and 12
provincial sites, such as Mo Tat Village, the outpost ofMo Nhal, Pac Mo
Village, Nong Luc Temple, etc.

A brochure produced by the Lang Son government alsodescribed Bac Son as a
mostly mountainous area with majestic views andbeautiful landscapes at Tam Hoa
Lake, Vu Lang Lake, Pac Mo Lake, etc.

Among the many attractions of the district, to somephotographers and tourist
Bac Son valley is a must-see â€œat least once in alifetime.â€

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57%20002.jpg)

The valley is quite wide, surrounded by row after row ofcloud-covered
mountains. The township of Bac Son occupies just a little patchof this level
valley. Paddy fields take up the rest of it.

Tay peopleâ€™s habitats, rice fields and hundreds of stiltedhouses, have a
contributed to the dreamy grandeur of Mother Natureâ€™s creation,making a
poetic picture of subtle idyll.

The colors and the overall feel of Bac Son change all thetime. After rice-
planting season, the valley is filled with the sweet dampgreen of young rice
leaves. Before the harvest, itâ€™s a golden carpet shining inthe sun.

Photographer Nguyen Phung Chi, who has been to Bac SonValley over ten times,
remarked, â€œEven within a day, the valley changes itsbeautiful dresses so
many times, due to the constant change in density andmovement of mist and
clouds. These two elements and the sun in its dailyjourney from dawn to dusk
create countless subtle nuances in the colors andshades over the valley.â€

The mesmerizing height

â€œOne way to capture the beauty of Bac Son Valley in itsentirety is to climb
up the nearby peaks, and Na Lay Peak is the best. This600m-high spot offers a
360-degree view of the breathtaking, ever-changingwonder. Some photographers
bring tents and supplies to Na Lay Peak to stay awhole week to capture the
moment,â€ Chi added.

â€œFirst, it takes about 30 minutes to climb the 1,200 precariousmoss-covered
stone stairs. Then an hourâ€™s hike will take you to the Na Lay. Theview there
will blow away all the fatigue,â€ photo hunter Duy Lang shared.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57%20007.jpg)

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/57%20006.jpg)

He described the view: â€œAt dusk, the river in the middle ofthe fields glows
mysteriously, and the land seems to pull the last golden raysof the sun to
keep it from sinking. The sky slowly darkens. One after another,lights in the
town come up, like fire-flies playing among silent giganticlimestone
monuments. Early in the morning, the valley seems to slowly emergefrom under
the fluffy blanket of mist and bobbing white clouds. When the firstsun rays
appear from behind the rugged curtains, they light up the sky andreveal the
soft shawl of clouds around the neck of the mountains. And then, thesplendid
red disk rises, promising a glorious day and taking away the hearts
ofcontemplating souls.â€

Another photo hunter shared in â€œTrafficâ€ newspaper, â€œTheascent is quite
steep, and one must be careful not to slip. The hike rims themountainâ€™s
skirt, under dangling branches and leaves. Backs sweaty, faces redand short of
breath, (yet) none of us was numb in the legs. Here and there, thepath curved
out to the open space, exposing us to bright light and a corner ofBac Son
appeared like a promise of love, giving us an adrenaline surge thatspeeded up
our pace. Having photographed it so many times, I still canâ€™t helpfeeling
overwhelmed, standing on Na Lay Peak. Endless green mountains thatshine under
the sun embrace the valley. The coquettish blue river gracefullybelts the
paddy fields. Some patches harvested, some not yet, all are blurredunder the
smoke of burned thatch. Itâ€™s such a warm, radiant picture of fertilitythat
can soften any heart.â€

11/20/2019,Malaysia: a feast for the senses,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/malaysia-a-feast-for-the-senses/,,Text by Hoai Phuong; Photos by courtesy of gaya Travel Magazine,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5432a.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5432b.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5432c.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5432d.jpg,"No 3, Vol.12, November – December 2015

I was very excited to be invited to Malaysia by my friends in Gaya Travel
Company. Quickly I made the decision. I got the passport and prepared
everything within a week. Everything was ready the night before departure. I
only needed to wait. I could not believe it. I got to go to Malaysia.  
The plane landed in Kuala Lumpur airport at 8.35 a.m. Before the plane landed,
I got to take a peek out the window. In front of my eyes were endless green
fields.  
The people here were all friendly and happy. I was greeted by smiles
everywhere. The women in Malaysia are beautiful in their traditional clothing
with hoods. Before I ran out of surprises, it was time to take the plane to
Kuala Teregganu. This was the destination for my five-day Malaysia trip.  
I stayed in hotel Permai. It was comfortable and warm. It was an island, but
it is very lively. The streets were crowded even when it was at 12 p.m. But it
did not make me lose sleep. I slept before I even knew it. In the morning, I
was woken up by the local people’s peaceful chants. I went to Pulau Redang
Island at 8 a.m. by ship. The warm weather let me enjoy the overall beauty of
this beach. The water was emerald blue. Looking down at the water, I could see
the underwater coral. This beautiful scene attracted a lot of tourists. I took
a deep breath to feel the clean air running into my body.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5432b.jpg)  
On this trip, I had a chance to join in a local special festival – Terengganu
International Squid Jigging (2/6-7/6). As I knew, it was the second time it
took place. In the evening, we were divided into small groups to sail with
local fishermen. The groups of boats sailing smoothly on water took us out
pretty far. I took part in a squid jigging at night. How should I say it? It
was a great experience. I was instructed in detail on how to jig squids. It is
not complicated, but it requires patience. Time passes by slowly. Surrounded
by water, I started to feel cold. The night was pitch black; only lights on
the boats remained. It was past 7 p.m., but I had not caught anything. It
taught me that fishing is not easy and I came to sympathize with fishermen who
do this for a living. The yell of my friends interrupted my thoughts. We
caught some squids. So it was not too bad. We all felt lively again and we had
a delicious BBQ out in the sea with the fresh squids we had just caught.  
I left Redang the next morning. Longingly, I looked back and it felt like
Redang was waving me goodbye. I missed the sincere fishermen, the friendly
waiter who waited for me in front of Laguna Jetty Resort and took me to a
small corner which had a picture of Vietnamese refugees coming to Pulau Bidong
in May of 1975. It was a land with no people and the Malaysia government
helped them stay there. At one point, the number of Vietnamese people here
increased to 40,000 people. Since 1991, the government helped them to return
to their motherland and on 28 August 2005, the last Vietnamese refugee left.
It was a wonder that in such a faraway country, there was a place which was
once a home to many Vietnamese. He talked so enthusiastically that it almost
made me late for the boat. The good news is that if you want to visit the
historical island of Bidong, the resort has boats coming at 9 a.m. to take you
there in 30 minutes. I will visit it the next time for sure.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5432c.jpg)  
Leaving Redang Island, I visited Kenyir Elephant Village, a nature reserve for
elephants. I have always wanted to visit the Central Highlands in Vietnam to
see the elephants there. But I never got to do it. Luckily, this time in
Malaysia, I had the chance. Kenyir Elephant Village was as wide as a forest. I
got to see the elephants. Are they big? Yes they are. Are they aggressive? Not
at all. They all seemed tamed; some could even perform tricks. It was an
interesting experience which I could only see on TV. They even waved goodbye
to visitors by spraying water.  
On the 4th night, we came back late after visiting China Town because that
beautiful and lively place with its noisy atmosphere and Chinese culture
blending with the Malaysian attracted many tourists. The main colour here was
red, and it was everywhere, from houses, shops along the streets decorated
with classic lanterns, to Chinese women. As I came on the weekend, I had the
opportunity to see the traditional lion dances and bronze drums.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5432d.jpg)

Finally, I got the chance to go shopping at a local market, Pasar Payang, near
China Town. They sold a lot of batik cloth – a special cloth made by
Malaysians. You will be surprised by its special decoration pattern, with the
main theme being natural and bold colourful geometry shapes. It feels light
and cool to touch. A piece of batik cloth is not just clothing, it is like a
painting. I bought some after choosing for a while. You should also try the
mangoes here, as they taste really sweet and good. If the airport did not
prohibit bringing this fruit on planes, I would bring a lot of them back home
as gifts for my friends in Vietnam.  
And there still are many great places; the culture village of Setiu where I
could dive and pick pretty clams and be greeted warmly.  
A week passed by really fast… I thank you all, the beautiful country of
Malaysia for letting me enjoy many different feelings and meeting many good
international friends during my stay. I wonder when we will meet again. I will
never forget you. See you again, Malaysia.n

Shinkansen (the bullet train) is known as the symbol of modern technology in
Japan. Thailand is known as the best place around the world to try â€˜tuk
tukâ€™ travelling. In Vietnam, the â€˜Reunification Railwayâ€™, a steel artery
running the length of country, is an affordable and relatively comfortable
transportation for locals and visitors alike.  
Summer is the time for vacation. In Vietnam, trains frequently are chosen by
families on long journeys, because of their safety and convenience. Night
falls and wind makes the air cooler, driving the heat of summer day away. With
a bag on my back, wearing a T-shirt and shorts, I got out of the cab and
walked to the Hanoi railway station. The moment I stepped in the hall, I was
surprised to see that it looks like a playground rather than a hall for people
waiting for the trains. Children were chasing each other around with toys.
Parents were chatting about their daily lifeâ€™s stories; football matches for
men, fashion and clothes for women. Smiles were on their faces because they
knew that they were going to have some leisure time.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5414b.jpg)  
Railway running along Song Gianh River, Quang Binh Province.

From the stationâ€™s loudspeakers, the warm sound of a womanâ€™s voice called
the name of train, which was already prepared to welcome its passengers and
required travellers enter Platform 1. Getting on the train, looking for my
seat with the number printed on the ticket, one uniformed attendant for the
Railways station helped me put luggage up to the hanger. A last urgent call in
staccato Vietnamese filled the warm night air. After one long blast and one
short toot on the horn, the train slid gently off into the night on its
33-hour, 1,070-mile journey to Vietnamâ€™s second city, Ho Chi Minh City.  
Seats include soft-chairs and soft-sleepers. Soft-chairs are arranged along
both sides of the carriages, while soft-sleepers are divided into compartments
with four sleepers for each one. I made myself comfortable with one soft-
chair. On one corner of the train, young students were arguing about places
they would visit when arriving and then they played cards. One family stayed
in front of me, the mother singing a lullaby for her daughter. It had been a
long day and sleep came easily in my soft-chair on the gently rocking train.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5414c.jpg)

The next morning when I raised the blind, the sun was rising and rural Vietnam
was running fast past the window; rice paddies, water buffalo, villages and
farms. In the first 200 kilometres from Hanoi, civilization consists of crops
of deep-water rice, villages with houses made from brick, banyan-trees and
bamboo trees.  
Pagodas made from wood represent Mahayana Buddhism, the most thriving religion
in the Vietnamese ancient kingdoms, while temples represent Confucianism.
After crossing the north middle mountainous area of Vietnam, the train reached
Hai Van pass, the present internal administrative border line between Hue
province and Da Nang city, also the natural border line between ancient
kingdoms in Vietnam and the cultural border line between Confucianism and
Mahayana Buddhism in the North with Hinduism and Theravada Buddhism in the
South.  
Through the trainâ€™s windows, I saw whole scene of empty beaches, islands and
sea. The train slowed to an easy ramble and clambered into the hills, hugging
the cliffs, with the sea breaking on the rocks below.  
The railway ducked under the higher peaks in a series of tunnels. On this
trip, the pass was covered with thousands of white blossoms on both sides of
the railway; it made one of the most incredible scenes I have ever seen in my
life.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5414d.jpg)

Crossing over the Hai Van pass, the train reached Danang city â€“ the city of
the International firework contest for the last two years and the main gate to
Hoi An ancient town for visitors.  
Up to this point, the train had travelled along the coastal area of Middle
Vietnam, the area of Champa, one ancient kingdom in Vietnam. The Cham
minority, descendants of the Champa kingdom, still maintain their ancestorsâ€™
way of life and cultural heritage. Cham temples are preserved perfectly; they
believe in Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva-the Hindu Gods trinity. In the golden age
of Champaâ€™s ancient kingdom, from the 9th to the 10thcentury, in the middle
of Vietnam, the Cham inhabited a vast territory, leaving behind original
construction and specific cultural treasures.  
The smell of seawater following the wind flows into the trainâ€™s carriages.
Sunshine leaks through windows. White sand hills lay on both sides of the
railway.  
Saigon appears on maps as Ho Chi Minh City, the last destination on the
railway. Saigon makes an interesting contrast with its northern counterpart,
but whether itâ€™s Hanoi or Saigon, travelling by train at least one time in
Vietnam is always the best choice.n

**The train ticket from Hanoi to Saigon costs about VND1,000,000 to
VND1,100,000 for soft-chair, and from VND1,300,000 to VND1,400,000 for soft-
sleepers.

With 3,260 kilometres of coastline and numerous islands, one would expect
Vietnam to be a haven for beach holidays. To be sure, the country is home to a
number of supposedly beautiful beaches, but I have been disappointed by most
of the ones Iâ€™ve visited. Nha Trangâ€™s stunning bay is hemmed in by a wall
of high-rise buildings and plagued with souvenir-sellers, Mui Ne and Phu Quoc
are being intensely developed, and Hoi Anâ€™s beach is being washed away by
the sea.  
However, I recently found that at least one beautiful, largely unspoiled
getaway remains: the Con Dao archipelago, just a one-hour flight south of Ho
Chi Minh City. I stayed for four nights along with my girlfriend and was
hugely impressed by the stunning nature of the area, as well as the complete
lack of large-scale development.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5408b.jpg)  
The road to the airport offering dramatic sea and mountain views.

The drive from the tiny airport on Con Son, the archipelagoâ€™s main island,
into town provides a preview of what to expect: hills covered in dense jungle
in the interior, beautiful beaches and dramatic scenery along the coast. We
rented a motorbike from Con Dao Camping, a great choice for those on a budget,
and headed back towards the airport to get to Dam Trau Beach. The 20-minute
drive along the coast is a stunner, with hills dropping into the sea and
panoramic views of smaller, no less-rugged islands. Perhaps the most
incredible part of the drive is what you donâ€™t see.There are no high-rise
hotels or concrete â€˜tubeâ€™ buildings, no sea-side beer clubs or karaoke
joints, no garish Vinpearl resorts; just jungle and ocean.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5408c.jpg)

Located down a sandy path that branches left off the main road just before the
airport, Dam Trau is serviced by a couple of ramshackle restaurants and
features crystal-clear water. The runway ends farther down the beach, and
occasionally a turboprop plane rumbles overhead during takeoff. The remoteness
of the beach means it is very quiet, although away from the cafes, a fair bit
of garbage has washed ashore. The main area is kept very clean though,
something which canâ€™t always be said for beaches in Vietnam.  
The most well-known resort on Con Son is the Six Senses Con Dao, a very high-
end property with a private beach and discreet entrance in between the airport
and town. While staying there was out of the question for us, we did decide to
have dinner at the By the Beach restaurant one night, which is well worth
splashing out on. The design of the Six Senses uses natural elements, and the
resort feels completely at home among the lush fauna and white sand of the
area. Dining next to the beach with an empty bay stretching into the distance
was a treat that canâ€™t be copied elsewhere in the country.  
We were also able to enjoy the beach that sits smack in front of Con Dao
Camping and runs away to the right of the main boat pier. On the end of the
beach, a long, jungle-clad stretch of hills juts out into the ocean,
separating the area from the western side of the island. This deep, stunning
section of white sand was, amazingly, almost completely empty for the duration
of our stay. A number of locals come out once the sun begins to go down, but
during the day, we were able to soak up rays and cool off in the clear water
on our own. This was among the most beautiful beaches Iâ€™ve seen in Vietnam,
and there was no one there. This highlighted the off-the-beaten-path nature of
Con Dao.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5408d.jpg)

The next day, we drove over to the west side of the island, and while the
beaches in the east had been quite calm, strong winds buffeted this stretch of
coast, throwing impressive waves onto the rocky coast. The scenery was, if
possible, even more stunning than elsewhere on Con Son, with sweeping views of
the aquamarine sea and striking Hon Ba island. The road passes through a
scruffy fishing village before tapering off amidst verdant jungle. We stopped
and watched fishing boats come and go before returning to town, slightly sun-
and wind-burned from the drive.  
Another highlight of Con Son is the Van Son Pagoda, a five-minute drive west
on the coast road from town. Visitors have to climb up a steep set of stairs,
which are fortunately shaded from the blistering tropical sun, to reach the
complex. You are rewarded with views back towards town and the expanse of
white sand that fronts it, as well as the incredibly blue sea. They say if
youâ€™ve seen one pagoda youâ€™ve seen them all, but I found the architecture
and design here particularly impressive, even though Iâ€™ve seen countless
pagodas throughout Vietnam. Van Son may not fall under the category of natural
beauty, but it is well worth a visit.  
Con Son is also home to a lot history, particularly from the French colonial
period, reminders of which dot the island in the form of run-down mustard
yellow buildings and crumbling brick structures that served nefarious purposes
when the island served as a penal colony. In recent years,Vietnam has
obliterated much of its architectural past, so it was good to see that some
remains here, even if the buildings offer grim reminders of years gone by. One
wonders how well this history will be preserved if Con Dao is further
developed in the future.  
After five days of enjoying the sun and the sea, it was time to return to
manic Ho Chi Minh City, a rough adjustment after enjoying the nearly empty
roads of Con Son, where rush hour is an unheard-of concept. The island had
quickly become one of the best places Iâ€™ve traveled to in Vietnam, and I
canâ€™t believe just how quiet it is. It is true that airfare to the island is
on the pricier side and accommodation isnâ€™t as cheap as in more popular
spots like Mui Ne, but the quiet, hassle-free beauty more than makes up for
the extra expense. At the same time, I hope Con Dao remains off the agenda for
most visitors, as I have seen how widespread attention and cheap access has
changed Phu Quoc for the worse. Iâ€™m not sure what the future holds for the
archipelago, but for now, it offers an unbeatable combination of incredible
beauty and empty space.n

On October 24th, 1995, a total eclipse occurred in Phan Thiet. Scientists and
tourists from all over the world congregated here in this remote area to
behold the miracle moments when the solar flower magnificently blossomed in
the Binh Thuan sky. According to the Oriental I Ching philosophy, this is the
sacred moment of the harmony between Yin and Yang.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5308a.jpg)

Binh Thuan features a gorgeous, nearly 200 km-long coast line, stretching from
Tuy Phong to Bac Binh, Mui Ne, Ham Thuan Nam and Ham Tan. Captivating tourist
attractions in Binh Thuan such as Mui Ne, Co Thach, Bau Trang, Doi Hong, Suoi
Tien, Ke Ga and Ta Cu have gradually become common knowledge.  
Binh Thuan has always been generous in serving guests with its unique, natural
yields; tropical warm sunlight, long beaches lined with fine sand, lots of sea
breezes and clear blue water. Countless secluded streams, waterfalls and
rapids are found in the primal forests that make up Truong Son mountain range
in the West of Binh Thuan.

This land, moreover, is also extremely attractive to curious tourists who are
interested in learning about the local history and culture. Cham culture has
been in Binh Thuan for ages. Through many changes, Poshanu Cham tower is still
solemnly standing on the top of Ba Nai Mountain, contemplating the
universeâ€™s transformation. The Cham traditional dances, music, festivals and
handicrafts have been maintained and conserved until today.

Ke Ga lighthouse, which was established in 1900, plays an essential role in
the international maritime routes in the East Sea area. The water tower is
Phan Thiet cityâ€™s symbol. It was designed by the Kingdom of Laosâ€™ Prince,
Suphanuvong, in 1928. This is also the symbol of the Vietnam â€“ Laos
nationâ€™s friendship.  
Inside the Truong Tho Linh Son Pagoda on the Ta Cu mountain top lies a statue

It is a totally refreshing and different experience to wake up early in the
morning and visit the fish landings scattered along the Binh Thuan coastal
line. The festive atmosphere of those fish landings cheerfully ignite a new
day. The seaside air has imbued Binh Thuan people with certain
characteristics; hard-working, honest and especially friendly.

As a place rich in marine life, fish sauce-making has been Binh Thuanâ€™s
special and famous profession since ancient times. The fresh, sweet and
healthy blue dragon fruit is another distinctive specialty of Binh Thuan.  
The formation and development of Binh Thuan tourism began with â€˜the Pearlâ€™
Mui Ne. Beside the natural potential, policies and plans of the local
government and the support of local people, there are also great and
meaningful contributions from investors from all over the world.

Today, Binh Thuan welcomes millions of new and old tourists every year, thanks
to its own glamour. Those who come to visit Binh Thuan find the activities at
sea most interesting. Outdoor sports such as water jetting, surfing,
windsurfing and ballooning take place here.

an architecture ensemble with 5-star hotels, high-class restaurants, villas
for rent, golf courses and many other entertainment services.  
Most notable is probably the Champagne Castle, where there is a wine cooling
cellar, demonstrations of champagne making procedures and a display of many
kinds of rare champagne from all over the world.

conserved into a wonderful eco-tourism zone in Binh Thuan. This place offers
you not only a chance to enjoy nature, but also a thrilling experience of
driving an ATV on a winding road over the sand dulls.  
Together with the overall booming of the province, Phan Thiet City has also
renewed itself to be a young, fresh and potential urban area. Investors and
international brands are pouring here to do business and service of all types,
contributing to the whole landâ€™s development.

During the high-water season from September to November, water ferns cover the
surface of swampy cajuput forests, creating a beautiful natural scene.  
The most attractive in the Western South is the Tra Su Forest of Van Giao
Commune, Tinh Bien District, An Giang Province.  
Occupying about 845 ha, it is known as a pristine forest with a diverse
ecosystem. The most prominent flora is cajuput. The fauna includes many rare
species listed in Vietnamâ€™s Red Data Book: milky storks, lesser short-nosed
fruit bats, Indian egrets, walking catfish, painted storks, darters, and many
others.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5118b.jpg)

The deeper we go, the more fairy-tale-like it is. Pure white cajuput flowers
in full bloom fill the air with a soft aroma. Lotuses and water-lilies do a
catwalk on the water. Bright yellow Sesbania sesbans are waving in the wind.
Care-free birds land on trees and ferns as if we werenâ€™t there. Hung and
Khoi, two famous â€˜trampersâ€™ from Dong Nai Province, who were in the boat
with me, said, â€˜Itâ€™s worth the time and the road, really. Itâ€™s so
beautiful here. We will definitely come back here with a few more friends.â€™  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5118c.jpg)

After 10 minutes on a motor-boat, we came to a small boat dock. We changed to
a smaller boat to row further into the woods to see the biggest cajuput trees.
The birds here are talkative and make the forest noisier than the city. Mr
Nguyen Van Tuan, our boat guide, told us there are over-30-year-old cajuput
trees here, which host rare birds from the Vietnamâ€™s Red Data Book such as
painted storks and darters. There are plenty of fish in the water, including
many scientifically valuable species which are on the brink of extinction. The
forest is prettiest during the high water season, especially at dusk and dawn,
when thousands of birds come in wave after wave.  
Then we were taken to a watch tower to take a view of the whole forest.n

It is a marvel what the French and the Vietnamese made of a sandbank for that
is the translation of the word Sapa. With a high density of hotels and
restaurants, long ambling lanes and a pretty artificial lake Sapa has a great
deal of charm. Intended as a hill station to escape the sweltering lowlands
and the din and pollution of the cities, Sapa still serves that purpose.
However there is little point in coming here if you have Sapa town as a
destination. Better to use it as a base to explore the amazing forest and rice
terrace scenery and the huge bio and ethno diversity of these mountains
considered to be the eastern extremity of the Himalaya Range.  
After a six hour coach journey from Hanoi on the new freeway and then thirty
five kilometres of twisting mountain road affording great views of the
cascading rice terraces we stopped just outside my hotel greeted by smiling
young Hmong women most with a baby on their backs (Some of these bairns must
be â€˜rentedâ€™, I thought, they could not all be mothers).

After checking into my luxury room with full mountain view and a quick wash
and brush up I found myself seated on the terrace of the elegant U Sapa Hotel
with its fine French facade overlooking he famous love market square. With me
were Mr Phil Hoolihan and his wife Hoa of Ethos Adventure Day Tours, the
general manager of U Sapa, M Stephan Chaline, and three young Black Hmong
ladies resplendent in their traditional attire. We talked about the current
situation of tourism in Sapa and how much the local ethnic groupings benefit
from it. Phil then asks a very interesting question of one of the young women
who has just had a baby daughter: â€˜Will you teach your daughter how to make
traditional clothing?â€™ The answer is a definite, â€˜Yesâ€™. Phil and Hoa
strive to help maintain ethnic minority traditions and to ensure the
indigenous people get a fair deal out of tourism. They even have two Hmong
girls semi adopted and living with them.

With ‘Ethos Tours’ you are free to involve yourself as much as you like in the
planning of your trip. The basic outing on my first full day was a walk, then
to visit the guideâ€™s house and have lunch with the family. My particular
cultural wish was to hear the â€˜Khenâ€™ played. This is a six holed flute
like instrument with bamboo tubes protruding laterally from a central one of
cedar wood. I also requested trying out the local alcoholic beverage.  
We were headed for the village of Sau Chua, the highest in Vietnam at around
1,800 metres (5,900 feet) above sea level. My guide was Miss Ke. The Hmong are
often after named after objects which are important in their daily lives and
Ke means â€˜basketâ€™. Accompanying us was Mi, a fourteen year old trainee
guide.  
The village does look far from town but it was a circuitous road that took us
on a forty minute taxi drive to our dropping off point. We stopped at a
viewing point on the way with a huge rock with a pool behind it and in front a
sheer drop of several hundred metres. Ke pointed out a lone tree down in the
valley. â€˜Thatâ€™, she said, â€˜is the spirit treeâ€™. We Hmong cleared the
forest for habitation and farming. We left that tree to guard the spirit of
the forest. Anyone who harms the tree will fall illâ€™.  
Soon we were out of the car and our walk began. It is curious what
similarities there are between mountain folk worldwide. There was dry walling
just as I have seen in Wales. The Hmong I saw store their maize kernels in
little wooden granaries raised from the ground by pillars to keep out rodents
and with slits in the walls for ventilation. This I have seen in Spain and
Portugal. Some of the crops though that I saw were new to me. Ke showed me
hemp and indigo. Ke’s English was really good. She had learned a lot of quite
technical words and explained in detail how her people made their clothes from
hemp and how they obtained and used the indigo dye to colour them.  
There was one very pleasant surprise on this walk. Mi pulled foliage out of a
bush. Within half a minute she had fashioned and presented to me a little
horse. Green Hmong origami! â€˜All H’Mong children do thisâ€™, Mi explained.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5028d.jpg)  
Below: On the village road, Sapa. Photo: Tran Binh An

We reached a couple of small buildings. Clambering up a slope we found
ourselves at Ke’s house – a one storey wooden building with a small outside
loo and a sty with six pigs. There was a hen whose chicks were constantly
being shooed out of the house, There was air was smokey as the indoor cooking
was over a wood fire. Ke introduced me to her husband and to a cousin. The
cousin’s wife wearing the black hat that gives the name to the Black Hmong.
She was taking care of a baby while a two-year-old boy scampered about
providing amusement.  
We three men ate separately. They did not speak English and I soon found
myself learning Hmong phrases for â€˜This is goodâ€™, â€˜To your health and
let’s drinkâ€™. The meal of pork, rice and water spinach was accompanied by
copious glasses of home made rice wine. Just as with the Kinh majority there
was a lot of toasting. However my companions were notably less boisterous than
lowlanders.  
As we were eating Ke sat down by me and told me of the Hmong way of life. She
told me of her father who is a shaman who cures illnesses by driving out evil
spirits. Her mother is a herbalist and uses the forest as a pharmacy. She
spoke also of Hmong marriage which can be arranged, love, or by kidnapping.
The later she explained had strict rules with the girl being held for no
longer than three days and having the right to refuse marriage. Phil told me
later that this custom can range from having the collusion of the girl to
considerable coercion.  
Then at the height of the merriment a Khen musical instrument was produced and
the cousin treated me to a performance. I am not a musician but I had a go and
was able to produce, with a little instruction, some fairly pleasant sounds.
Finally the cousin donned traditional clothing and we all went outside where
the cousin played more performing an extraordinary dance. He gyrated and
swirled quite close to the ground. I could not see a meaning but perhaps he
was imitating the mating dance of some exotic bird.  
I hope I have whetted your appetite for some Sapa adventure. I had only had a
mere taste of it. Two days in Sapa should be the absolute minimum stay. A week
or more is needed. This is an area to savour and not just tick off a list. The
rice terraces are amazing but it is the gentle peoples who work them that is
the biggest draw. They lead difficult lives but not the often agitated life of
a city dweller like me who needs the occasional escape. â€˜Go Sapaâ€™ is my
advice to you and I hope you find yourself in as welcoming, knowledgeable ,and
culturally sensitive hands as I experienced with the U Sapa Hotel – Ethos Tour
Company partnership.

A lonely tree on the way to Bau Trang

Once, during our visit to Mui Ne of Phan Thiet City, a local friend told us,
â€˜If you want to sleep in a desert, you can go to Hoa Thang Commune, about 30
kilometres from here. They have a few very cheap inns near the White Sand Hill
tourist area.â€™  
We departed at once, anticipating a story worthy of Scheherazadeâ€™s Arabian
Nights.  
Leaving Mui Ne, our road was lined with the vast blue sea on the right and
endless heaves of sand dunes on the left. Occasional gusts of wind from the
sea stirred up whirls of sand.  
We came to a small fishing village, but saw no inn at all. The road looked
like a grey trike of brush over a pale pink sand canvas. Red sunset added a
touch of myth and loneliness to the whole picture.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5008b.jpg)  
Some chopped trees on the way to Bau Trang

The view was panoramic, like in a Western cowboy movie. Finally, we found a
â€˜room for rentâ€™ sign. The host, a grocer named Chau said, â€˜This is Hong
Lam village of Hoa Thang Commune, Bac Binh District, Binh Thuan Province. A
double room here costs VND120,000/night.  
The 60-year-old man told us, â€˜I lived my whole life here. This place used to
be completely desolate. Since this road was asphalted and the tourist area
nearby was opened, people began to come this way. I built these six rooms for
hire five years ago. From time to time, I have a Vietnamese guest. Foreigners
are very rare, all seem cautious, some even scared. Perhaps being in a
desolate place abroad is quite uncomfortable, but the reality is that the
folks here are absolutely harmless.â€™

8 p.m. We took a walk outside. It was pitch dark. â€˜Itâ€™s so quite. So
great! Truly an oasis in a desert,â€™ my companion exclaimed.  
In the morning, we went to the only place in the village that served
breakfast, just a few houses down the road. The fish noodles were exactly like
those made in an oasis. Surprisingly, it cost only VND10,000.  
We approached old people we found here and there to learn more about Hong Lam
village. It had about 500 households that dwell on the south of the fresh
water White Lake, which is 150 m wide and about 2 km long.  
The villagers earn mostly by planting lotus, beans, and rice and fruit trees.
The lush green around the lake was so bright on the dry, sandy background. An
old man told us that Bau Trang (White Lake) was about 20m deep in the rainy
season. A long time ago, it was divided into two; the bigger half was named
the Grandma Lake, and the smaller, the Grandpa Lake. In summer, itâ€™s so
beautiful with lotuses that they call it the Lotus Lake.  
On the dam separating the lakes there is a temple, named the Temple of Hong
Lam Lady. The temple keeper, an 81-year-old man named Mr Sau who spent his
whole life in the village, told us many tales about the temple. The most
interesting was as follows:  
â€˜Over 200 years ago, there was a princess named Lu Phung Cong, beautiful as
a fairy, who possessed the power of commanding heavenâ€™s forces. Once, as she
and her entourage journeyed past Hong Lam, a big storm raised a cloud of sand
and hid the sun. To protect the village and her followers, she used her power
to quiet the storm. After she died, the villagers deified her and built the
temple to worship her. The temple was almost in ruins, but the worship never
ceased. In 2010, people contributed to rebuild it.â€™

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5008d.jpg)  
Water lily bloomed on Bau Trang

At 11 a.m., the innkeeper served our ordered lunch, which included rice, fish-
and-sour soup, at VND25,000 per ration. Filled, we took a siesta. Outside,
Hong Lam was baked in a gigantic sand oven.  
Learning that we would go see the White Sand Hill in the afternoon before
leaving, Mr Chau said, â€˜Nobody can bear the heat of the hill in the
afternoon. Itâ€™s best to go there at sunrise, when itâ€™s beautiful and cool.
People come here from far away only to see the sunrise.â€™  
At 4.30 a.m., we rode about two kilometres to the White Sand Hill, a 100 ha
desert within the desert, also called the White Lake Hill because it was on a
bank of the other White Lake.  
On the lake bank, there were three food shops that also lent off-road vehicles
and boats.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5008e.jpg)  
A boat on Bau Trang

There were hundreds of domestic and foreign tourists. The moment the rim of
the sun came over the horizon behind the sea, all eyes and cameras turned
eastward.  
Seen from a high dune top, the White Sand Hill stood out amongst colourful
surroundings; blue sea in the east, peaceful Hong Lam village in the south-
south west, reflected in the dark blue water of the lake, and pale pink sand
dunes spotted with dwarfish dry bushes in the north.  
Some people hired cars and off-road vehicles to roar up the dunes; some others
hired little boards to slide down 20 metres high dunes.  
Only then I understood why the White Lake was not only a tourist attraction,
but also a source of inspiration for artists and photographers.n

In Phan Thiet City many hotels, inns and cafÃ©s have motorbikes for rent at
VND150,000 -VND180,000/day.  
Many hotels in Mui Ne have Jeep transport service to White Sand Hills at
VND400,000/Jeep (3-4 persons).  
At White Lake the off-road vehicle rent is VND450,000/30 minutes.

I believe that to anyone, whether old or young, rich or poor, successful or
unsuccessful, in his or her heart, the image of his native land is always the
most beautiful one. Nghe An, a province in the North Central Coast region of
Vietnam, is indeed the sweetest place to me; where I was born and grew up in
my motherâ€™s arms and my fatherâ€™s love. The memory of the joyful days of my
childhood spent in my native land in the company of friends and my beloved
people will never fade over time.  
And yet, there is nowhere in Vietnam as miserable as my native land because in
the fierce years of the resistance, people here suffered lots of lethal
bombings. Moreover, after the war, thousands of mothers lost their children
and thousands of wives lost their husbands. The bittersweet truth is that all
of those corpses made the soil rich and contributed to making the country more
lush and green.  
I know that my native land is economically poor, but people around me are
sentimentally rich. People say that although women in Nghe An arenâ€™t sweet
and gentle, they are very loyal. In the war years, they were not only involved
in both production and fighting to defend the rear area, but they also longed
all night for their husbands and children to return from the battle. Perhaps,
only these women could do such wonderful things. If you visit Nghe An even
once, you will realize that it is more beautiful than luxurious cities.  
Referring to Nghe An province means referring to the native land of President
Ho Chi Minh. Among the national heroes, he is the person who was simpler, more
public-spirited and more unattached to materialism than all others. He is the
crystallization of the most beautiful quintessence of the country tempered
through several thousands of years of history. He is the only Vietnamese man
called â€˜uncleâ€™ by all generations. Therefore, I am proud of having been
born in Nghe An, which gave birth to a person like him.  
Besides its magnanimous tradition in national defence and construction, the
people here are very proud of their learning tradition. If you visit Nghe An,
maybe you will be so surprised because most schools are spacious, high-rise
buildings. Because its people are fond of learning, Nghe An has given birth to
many scholars, outstanding poets and writers such as Ho Xuan Huong and Ho Chi
Minh. Every year, most valedictorians in the university entrance exam come
from Nghe An. What a wonderful land!  
Two thirds of Nghe An provinceâ€™s land area is forest. The Creator has
endowed it with beautiful landscapes for tourism development. Among them is
its long coast with pristine beaches, especially Cua Lo, which is considered
one of the best in Vietnam, and Pu Mat National Park, which brings a sense of
romantic adventure.  
If you live in Nghe An, you will note that itâ€™s freezing outside in winter
and you will huddle in a warm quilted blanket. Yet many farmers still have to
sit up late and get up early to work very hard in the fields despite the cold
weather. On the other hand, itâ€™s scorching outside in summer. At that time,
maybe you just want to hide in your house to avoid the sun. However, in the
fields, many little children do graze cows and cut grass.  
In each evening, it is calm. A hedge of bamboos is outlined sharply and from
the fields, the distant croak of frogs resounds. And in the rice harvest, the
golden ears of rice are stacked in rows at the side of the field. The rustle
of the stalk of rice is like the sound of browsing cattle. My native land in
these days is so busy and animated.  
In my heart, the image of my native land connects closely with such simple
things. And only when seeing people here struggle against floods and storms
yearly, can you know why I love my native land so much.n

Binh Thanh Commune of Tuy Phong District, Binh Thuan Province, though
occupying only 27,7 square kilometres, has two national cultural relics,
including Co Thach Pagoda and Binh An Temple, which has a dozen structures
with a regal appearance.  
Apart from that, Binh Thanh also has the Lord of South Sea tomb, almost 200
years old, that houses a whale skeleton; a memorial of a massacre over 60
years ago; and a beach famous forseven-colour pebbles.  
We drove 300 kilometres from Saigon to Lien Huong township of Tuy Phong, then
turned to provincial road No.716 and went another 10 kilometres to reach Co
Thach (Old Rock) Pagoda.

**The old temple in a cave  
** Co Thach Pagoda is not big. It stands on a slope, about 64 metres above the
sea.  
According to the Vietnam Buddhist Association webpage, in the mid-19th
century, Zen monk Bao Tang found a desolate shore cave in a spiritual land and
decided to use it as his place of worship. A little later, to pay respect to
his virtues, a rich man named Ho Cong Diem built a nice temple and named it Co
Thach. Since then, the pagoda has passed to four generations of virtuous head
monks and has been renovated many times.  
â€˜Co Thach preserves many valuable cultural heritage items, which include
highly sophisticated inscriptions, historical documents dating from the time
the temple was established, and bells and drums made in early 19th century,â€™
according to the Tuy Phong District webpage.  
In the five ha premises of Co Thach, there are many age-old trees and big
rocks with Buddha statues on them.  
â€˜The North-East slope behind the pagoda has many caves formed by large
strange-looking rocks. Some caves are so deep that people thought they were
the way to the underworld. Behind the three-doorgate is a cave formed by three
rocks which look like a whale (a benevolent fish), a toad (representing
chastity) and the Bat Nha boat that carries people to the Domain of Awakening.
There are many altars inside the cave for AmitÄbha Trinity, Shakyamuni,
Ksitigarbha, CunÃ¯dÃ¯hi and Bodhidharmaâ€™ according to the Vietnam Buddhist
Association sources.

**The seven-colour pebbles**  
Walking about 500 metres down from the pagoda, we came to the famous beach
with billions of pebbles of different colours, including yellow, grey, black
and white. The beach is about 1.5 kilometres long and 250 metres wide.  
The waves come and go, making the pebbles knock against each other. Each time,
it sounds like a beach of firecrackers. The pebbles shine all their glorious
colours under the blazing sun.  
Scientists say that an undersea current brought these pebbles and formed a
nearly 250,000-cubic-metre opencast quarry.

**The gruesome massacre  
** About 2.5 kilometres from Co Thach, there is a memorial for a gruesome
massacre that happened over 60 years ago.  
The stele relates that early morning of 20 February, 1951, a French regiment
moved in to Cat Bay Village and opened fire. They killed 311 people, burned
houses and raped many women.  
Having burnt incense for the dead, we entered the village. Cat Bay with its
few hundred roofs feels vaguely nostalgic.  
80-year-old Duong Minh Thoi, one of the ten survivors, recalls the horror.  
â€˜That morning, my family was having cassava for breakfast. Suddenly the
legionnaires surrounded the village. A group of soldiers came to my house and
shouted â€˜Everybody up! Out!â€™ All 12 of us huddled together inside in fear.
They started shooting at us, and then burnt the houseâ€¦â€™  
The frail old man added, because many families have no descendants to take
care of the family altar, villagers contributed money to build the memorial in
2001. Since then, every first full moon, villagers collect rice, sugar and
other items to make sacrificial sweets and come to the memorial to pray for
the souls of the dead to reach salvation.n

At East Terminal of Saigon, there are about 10 buses going to Lien Huong

At Lien Huong Township and next to Co Thach Pagoda there are about 20 inns.
The room rate is VND120,000- VND150,000 per night on average.

People donâ€™t automatically put the words â€˜Sapaâ€™ and â€˜adventureâ€™ in
the same sentence. And I donâ€™t blame them. You go to see mountains covered
in paddy fields, little Vietnamese villages in all their glory, beautiful
people dressed in traditional clothes, colourful markets, bamboo forests, and
everything else that makes Sapa what it is, but you donâ€™t go there for
adventure.  
When I went to enjoy Sapa with my cousin, we were not planning on gray and
cloudy days. We were not planning on continuous drizzle. We were thinking
about beautiful sunsets and a clear horizon. But thatâ€™s not what we got, and
it made our trip unforgettable.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/2247b.jpg)  
The tour guide and her newborn. Photo: Loes Heerink

We booked ourselves a train to Lao Cai Province. We were picked up by a little
van. The driver drove the wet, curvy roads like he was being chased by the
police. It was nerve-racking, to say the least.  
After arriving at our little hotel and taking a shower, we went for breakfast.
I assumed it wasnâ€™t going to be anything special, judging by the rooms and
the shower. But I was wrong. We walked up to the top floor, where there was a
balcony looking out over the valley; seeing those mountains covered in rice
fields was amazing.  
We booked a private tour with the Sapa Sisters, a group of local woman who
give personal tours. While arranging this, we were asked what we were looking
for in a tour. And I asked for the â€œleast touristic routeâ€ we could get.  
A small woman, Tam, dressed in traditional clothing and plastic sandals,
picked us up after breakfast. She was a big contrast to me and my cousin with
our comfortable trousers and hiking shoes. We took a small backpack and left
the rest of our belongings at the little hotel. To my surprise, our guide was
carrying a five-month old boy on her back. He goes with her to work every day.  
We walked along the highway through the little village until we were close
enough to the rice fields. Now, most tourists keep walking along the highway,
but not us. We took a left turn and landed immediately between those fields.  
Due to the drizzle, the paths between the fields were muddy and slippery. This
caused us to struggle to stay on the path without falling. The rice fields are
levelled differently, so we had to climb up and down the fields, jumping up
and down the path every now and then, holding on to whatever we could, while
jumping from one path to the other. Pretty soon, Tam found two bamboo sticks
and cut them into walking sticks for us, to help us keep balance. The
difference between and her and us became painfully clear after that; she, with
her baby boy and sandals, was not having any difficulties. We in our good
hiking gear and walking sticks were trying not to slip and fall into a rice
field.  
At some crossings, Tam asked us if we wanted to take the less difficult or
more difficult route. And of course, we kept on choosing the difficult one. We
hiked through more and more remote areas. Up and down more mountains. And
there were more and more slippery slopes. In the beginning we were just
struggling not to fall. But after a while, the struggle became more of
competition between me and my cousin. We both knew our guide wasnâ€™t going to
slip off the path and slide down the mountain or fall into a rice field.  
We were literally walking through the rice fields, down those little dirt
roads in between the fields and crossing little streams and bamboo forests as
we went up and down the mountain. We all know what happens to dirt roads when
itâ€™s drizzling. Luckily, nobody got hurt and eventually we didnâ€™t even
fall. We did have a ton of laughs about the possibility of one of us ending up
sliding off the mountain a couple of metres or ending up face down in a rice
field. Oh, the joy I had exploring beautiful Sapa. I didnâ€™t only get to see
those rice field covered mountains everybody is talking about. I got to
experience them.

During breaks, we enjoyed the view. Our guide gave us loads of information
about the area-that it was quite normal for cousins to get married, for
instance.  
I took this tour a while ago. And the one thing I remember most is how much
fun we had walking those slippery slopes. Yes, Sapa is gorgeous and
breathtakingly beautiful. But for me, that will always be the second thing
coming to mind when thinking of Sapa.

Fansipan, the highest mountain in Indochina with an altitude of 3,143 m, Lao
Cai Province, Northwestern Vietnam. Photo: Hoang The Nhiem

Surfing on-line, I stumbled on a picture of golden sunrays penetrating
carefree cotton clouds which wander aimlessly over rugged mountains.
Impressed, I slowly scrolled through them all, one by one.

The page contained thousands of photographs taken not only in Vietnam, but
also in Nepal, China and Tibet.

I imagined that the page owner must be very weather-worn, passionate and
patient enough to hike all the mountains along the country down to the
intricately-tattooed Mekong river delta, out to far away little islands, and
back up to the mysterious heights of Tibet, only to take pictures.

My fascination took me to him, Mr Hoang The Nhiem.

He received me in a room with a large cutting-edge picture printing machine.
He looked rather a seasoned scholar, nothing of the man I imagined.

The man told me about his professional photography destiny. â€˜After finishing
my studies at the Polytechnique Institute, I started working in ocean trading.
I sailed around the world and was overwhelmed by the beauty and grandeur of
ever-changing nature. In 1995, I decided to quit drifting to dedicate myself
to artistic photography.

A few years after that start, he bought four motorbikes and left them at his
acquaintancesâ€™ in different cities around the country.

â€˜Since then, I went to all places in Vietnam. Sometimes I stayed for months.
You have to plough a land over and over again and then maybe with luck, you
will get its feel into your picture. I always study carefully the geography,
climate, cultural elements and local customs of a place before I go there,â€™
he said.

â€˜Some places such as Sapa are beautiful but the weather is unpredictable. I
went there almost 30 times.â€™

Obsessed with Sapa, he spared no time and effort to study the elements that
make the weather there so coquettish. â€˜The mountains, rivers and vegetation
remain almost the same. Only the clouds and the winds are unpredictable. The
photographer who understands the nuances of these may make beautiful pictures
that impress.â€™

Loving Sapa, Mr Nhiem understands any change of the clouds and winds there.
â€˜I know when sunlight accentuates the uncatchable beauty of the clouds, when
the clouds filter the brightest rays of light, and when the clouds and the sun
mingle in a mythical carnival of the gods,â€™ he shared.

He loved most the clouds and sun on the Fansipan peak, the rooftop of
Indochina. He hiked up there many times, despite the unruly weather and
treacherous trails.

When I asked how many pictures he had taken, he said the number must be in the
tens of thousands.

â€˜Among those posted on the web which one is your favourite?â€™I asked.

He hesitated a moment, â€˜I love them all. They are all my children,â€™ he
said.

â€˜Each one of those was chosen among hundreds, even thousands of pictures of
the same content.â€™

In Mr Nhiemâ€™s photo library I saw many which showed destroyed forests, black
polluted rivers and beaches that became cemeteries of marine life. â€˜I love
to take pictures of the beautiful, but am ready to face the ugly. I want to
show the truth and let people think about it,â€™ he said.

And his hunts were not limited to Vietnam. He went places around the world.

I asked, â€˜How do you find Vietnamese beauty and culture, compared to other
countries?â€™ He said, â€˜Vietnam has a lot of beautiful places and our
culture is very diverse. For example, compared to a big country such as China,
with a very old culture, Vietnam is very beautiful and unique. Panoramically,
Vietnam may not be as beautiful as China, but from a middle distance and close
up, Vietnam has countless beauties that canâ€™t be mistaken for any other
country. Culturally too, Vietnam is more special, more exotic.â€™

â€˜Did technical knowledge you learned from college help you in any way with
artistic photography?â€™

â€˜Of course, a lot. Perhaps my advantage is that I know well the
functionalities of digital cameras,â€™ he said.

Mr Hoang The Nhiem

Hoang The Nhiem was born in 1960, in Saigon. He started professional
photography in 1995, specializing in scenery and tourist photography. He
published two collections, â€˜Call of Seasonsâ€™ (four volumes) and â€˜Sapa
Coloursâ€™, and has had private exhibitions in Vietnam, France, Belgium,
Switzerland, Singapore and the US.

He won many domestic and international prizes, most notably: two National
Outstanding prizes for photographic books (in 2003 and 2011) and three
National Outstanding pictures prizes (in 1999, 2000 and 2012).

**Rustic lagoon offers a taste of its storied past**

During the era of Emperor Minh Mang, Tam Giang Lagoon went by the names Thien
Hai, Hac Hai and Hat Hai, which means â€˜Shallow Oceanâ€™. The latter name
really holds true for anyone whoâ€™s come here to greet the dawn or watch the
sunset on the vast waters of undulating ripples, see the junks going upstream
and downstream casting nets or view scenes of the lives of fishermen on the
lagoon.  
The Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon system is considered one of the largest salt
marshes in Southeast Asia. This is precisely the region that regulates the
climate between two sandy areas, moderates the floods, and limits the danger
of the delta getting waterlogged. Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon functions to
maintain the groundwater of the delta along the banks and the sandy regions
along the seacoast. It maintains the peopleâ€™s daily source of water and is
the place that restores the water quality before it flows out to sea.  
Tam Giang Lagoon is freshwater during the flood season and brackish during the
dry season. Because of this, the aquatic environment here is extremely
plentiful; many aquatic and marine species live here. The lagoon is a source
of precious resources for the fishermen who exploit it for their livelihood.  
Tam Giang Lagoon was mentioned in Le Quy Donâ€™s â€˜Phu Bien Tap Lucâ€™
(â€˜Miscellaneous Records of Consoling [the People of] the Frontierâ€™). The
Nguyen Dynastyâ€™s National History Agency also mentioned Tam Giang Lagoon in
the â€˜Dai Nam Nhat Thong Chiâ€™ (Complete Gazetteer of Dai Nam), which
primarily talked about the formation and hazardous wild features of the place.
Among common folk, the people pass on the famous folk song, â€˜Loving you, I
want to come, too/fearful of Ho Moor and fearful of Tam Giang Lagoon.â€™ At
that time, Tam Giang Lagoon was a broad land area flooded in water, full of
mud, and inundated with unpredictable hazardous winds and waves. Boats going
back and forth easily encountered calamities. Tam Giang Lagoon was moreover a
place where thieving bandits hid themselves.  
Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon is no longer desolate as in the past. In recent
years, Thua Thien-Hue Province has invested in and developed the building up
of the lagoon, as well as exploiting tourism.  
A Hue friend told me that Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon is becoming an attractive
tourism site for visitors. The traffic routes from Hue City down to Tam Giang
Lagoon are now quite favourable, so at the end of the day and week many people
frequently come here to enjoy specialties.  
Mr Dinh Tien Dungâ€™s Dam Chuon (Dragonfly) Diner is one of the countless
eateries that lie on Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon belonging to the Phu An
Residential Zone of Phu Vang District in Thua Thien-Hue Province. The diner is
made entirely out of bamboo and lies tottering on the waterâ€™s waves. The
tables are low-set, while customers sit on mats or small cushions. The dishes
here primarily consist of the shrimp and fish caught in the lagoon.  
Customers who come here enjoy the dishes while viewing the cloudy skies or the
boundless waves. Before enjoying nature products, they get to have none other
than the owner invitingly pour into their cups â€˜tra trangâ€™ or â€˜white
tea,â€™ which is a specialty distilled by the diner. A cup of Dam Chuon
(Dragonfly Lagoon) liquor is refreshingly sweet and spreads throughout the
bodyâ€”warm and rich but not jolting. All one needs is to start off with a cup
of â€˜tra trangâ€™ and the atmosphere of the meal comes alive. To the side on
the diner wall a guitar is always placed.

**_The estuary where the Huong, Bo and O Lau rivers converge before going out
to sea at Thuan An Harbour, Tam Giang Lagoon, which runs about 27km long with
an area of 5,200ha.  
The Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon system is a place rich in abundant plant and
animal resources of first-rate value in the region of Southeast Asia. Recent
investigative data reveals that 230 species of fish, 63 species of underwater
animals, 43 species of algae, 70 species of birds, 15 species of sea egrets,
171 species of phytoplanktonand 37 species of zooplankton exist here. Among
them, 30 species of fish are of economic value, consisting of 70 per cent of
that exploited yearly. Tam Giang-Cau Hai has 34 species of migratory birds and
36 species of autochthon birds concentrated in the region of O Lau and Dai
Giang harbours.  
_**

The dinerâ€™s owner related that he pioneered the diner on the lagoon a decade
ago. The diner has remained simplistic and without alteration since its
inception. Before engaging their meal, customers can have the owner show them
how to cast small nets or look at bamboo traps with which he catches the fish
and shrimp.  
In order to get to the diner, customers have to take a boat from the
lagoonâ€™s bank and meander past the bordering fences around shrimp and fish
nurseries for about 15-20 minutes. Thatâ€™s sufficient time to take pictures
of the scenery and activities on the lagoon. The eyeâ€™s purview of the
surface of the lagoon seems endless and is interspersed by rows of jagged
bamboo running up and down the lagoon. Every once in a while, narrow fish
lookout towers appear, adorned with several altars draped in red cloth that
lie precariously perched atop the bamboo stalks.  
At present, there are ten Dam Chuon Diners. Some diners invest a billion dongs
to build and decorate floating restaurants that hold up to a hundred
customers. Mr Dungâ€™s grass diner only holds, at most, 20-30 customers at a
time. Foreign tourists, too, frequently choose Mr Dungâ€™s diner to eat,
drink, and take in the landscape.

25-storey Liberty Central Saigon Riverside Hotel, built on the scenic
esplanade of Saigon River, impresses one with an elegant look even from a
distance. Its spacious foyer in light beige and champagne colours with vibrant
and stylish interior design and futuristic satelite lounge chairs look
sparklingly refreshing. After a quick check-in, I was standing by the floor-
to-ceiling panorama windows, watching the poetic vista of the chocolate-
coloured waters of the Saigon River with a picturesque quay and a line of
leisure vessels at anchor. The wide plane of a neighbouring residential
quarter, full of green groves stretching across the river pleased the eye and
was surprising to observe from a hotel situated in the very centre of bustling
metropolis of Saigon, at half minute walk to far-famed Dong Khoi Street.  
The room featured tasteful modern design with a fine combination of hazel,
beige and deep blue tones and minimalistic yet cosy furniture, all together
looking very spacious. Wide-screen LCD home cinema-size TV panels and glass
wall bathrooms were also present to add hi-tech touches to the room.  
Liberty Central Saigon Riverside Hotel offers a wide choice of well-appointed
and upscale accommodation to fit any taste. The hotel interiors boast a
refreshingly dynamic yet peaceful ambience with cosy and stylish sitting
areas, tastefully-appointed furnishing and creative design solutions to fit
both leisure and business travellers.  
As for in-house facilities Liberty Central Saigon Riverside Hotel offers a lot
of options for pleasantly surprising and impressive experiences to pamper all

on the beautifully designed mezanine floor or at the Central restaurant with
contemporary decor and three exquisite daily buffets, great breakfasts and
evening Cocktail Buffet free service at Club lounge for business travellers on
the 23rd floor, renowned wines and a plethora of cocktails at the Vertical sky
bar on the rooftop with views over Ho Chi Minh City at night and open swimming
pool contemplating the sunset from the rooftop deck with iced coffee or glass
of wine in hand amid orchids in full blossom can also become one of the
highlights of oneâ€™s stay in Saigon. Aesthetic delights of spectacular city
panoramas are also available at hotel health and spa centre fully equipped
with state-of-the-art fitness machines, an excellent option to do an intensive
or light workout after gourmet sessions or to pamper oneself after a busy day
of visiting city sites. The spa centre offers an extensive menu of massages
and outstanding sauna and steam bath private rooms with the bathtub set right

Boasting a prime location within few minutesâ€™ walk through an atmospheric
central quarter straight to the cityâ€™s main attractions, Liberty Central

The panorama from the window of my room-looking out down the wide boulevard,
beautifully framed with rows of giant maranti trees nearly reaching the level
of the 11th floor with their sprawling tops and the city centre with the sky-
high lotus-shaped Bitexco Tower and high-rises of office buildings and malls
at the distance was utterly impressive. Minutes ago, I enjoyed a slightly
dizzying taxi ride through a labyrinth of lanes packed with patchwork
groceries, tailors, motorbike repair and forging shops, food and fruit stands.
The beeways of streets suddenly interspersed with wide  
avenues jammed to the rafters with vehicles of all possible and impossible
kinds, outlined with smoking old pagodas and temples in fringes of whimsical
ornaments, boiling markets and streams of wandering hawkers. The taxi finally
moored to the entrance of the five-star Hotel Equatorial and I tottered
through the spacious and refreshingly cool lobby to the check-in counter. The
Hotel Equatorialâ€™s ground floor pleased the eye with elegant interiors and
tasteful decor as well as with huge spaces, an inviting and casually elegant
cocktail lounge, delicately accentuated with glass and wooden carved screens
and Chit Chat restaurant-cum-cafÃ© with a showcase displaying tempting French
pastry and Lunar New Year sweets.  
The Deluxe Room looked elegant and well-appointed, tastefully furnished with
an eye for utter comfort and functionality, equipped with a big working desk
and window lounge chair to contemplate a spectacular long-range view of the
city. The room boasted lots of natural light and a pleasant, unobtrusive
palette of beige and chestnut interior colours. The pleasant surprise that
followed was the access to Equator Club Lounge with separate front desk, cosy
restaurant where gourmet breakfasts and afternoon tea and drinks are served to
the Deluxe Club roomsâ€™ guests. The on-floor briefing room and separate
spacious smoking room are also available for Deluxe Club Room key holders.  
Hotel Equatorial features 333 guestrooms and suites, ranging from elegant
Deluxe and Premier to sumptuous Senator and Presidential suites with grand
Rome-style balconies, terraces overlooking the open swimming pool with bar and
appealing arched patio.  
The hotel combines, in an excellent and well-thought-out way, the full range
of facilities and services for both business and leisure guests. Its
favourable location on the intersection point of the cityâ€™s four most vivid
and colourful districts with abundance of inimitable oriental ambiance to
plunge in, including the famous boiling markets of Cholon, makes it a perfect
place to give oneâ€™s private southern capital discovery its kick start in an
impressive and non-trivial way. Situated on a quiet shadow alley eight
minutesâ€™ shuttle bus ride from District 1, Hotel Equatorial makes one feel
like they are staying not in a hotel in a bustling city, but in a resort with
a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere which is great to immerse oneself in after
a day of dizzying city street medley explorations or tense business meetings.
To strengthen the feelings are state-of-the-art Fitness & Leisure Centre with
full gym, spa centre with extended spa-menu and private massage rooms and
sauna; steam room and hot Jacuzzi pool.  
Awardâ€“winning and atmospheric Chit Chat Restaurant fascinates with the full
illusion of an Asian street food market with garlands of bunches of exotic
herbs, colourful stalls and live-cooking action stations, with rows and rows
of Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese and Malaysian dishes galore, went alive on
the hotel ground floor. Over 75 dishes are presented here in the culinary
collection of daily dinner buffets.  
Chit and Chat institution offers exclusive themed buffets, not to be missed
while in the city, such as â€˜Delightful Weekend Dim Sumâ€™ every Saturday and
Sunday and â€˜Seafood Extravaganzaâ€™ every Sunday. The last one conquered my
palate forever with freshest of the fresh oysters bursting with the flavour of
ocean depths, tamarind crab and a head-spinning mosaic of sashimi and rolls.  
Exquisite Orientica Restaurant, on the first floor of Hotel Equatorial, with
its elegant Asian-style interiors and feng shui  
inspired dÃ©cor, offers its guests an insightful and stylish outlook on the
enigmatic and multifaceted philosophy of Asian gastronomic culture, with
impressive pieces of high Asian cuisine.  
The culinary side of oneâ€™s stay at Hotel Equatorial provides a truly healthy
and flavourful whole-day buffet option and can be easily turned into a gourmet
food therapy to rehabilitate oneâ€™s precious self after a year of workdayâ€™s
hectic meals too.  
Hotel Equatorial has everything the most discerning traveller may need for a
memorable and truly five-star, international standard stay, starting from
elegant interiors and a full set of world-class facilities, through great
sightseeing city exploration options and up to the small details and surprises
that turn oneâ€™s stay into a unique experience to  
remember.

Mui Ne has been given the title of â€˜the resort capital of Southern
Vietnamâ€™ for a good reason. In less than eight years, it has metamorphosed
itself from a quiet seaside fishing village with no street names and small,
clay-tiled houses without numbers scattered along a sandy coastline under the
long, living dome of coconut trees, all bursting with rustic charm, into a
vibrant resort community with beachfront retreats in the shade of tropical
gardens overlooking the rolling sea and long lines of international
restaurants and souvenir shops on their backs.  
Rustic charm still can be found here a plenty by those who know where to
search for it. Those travellers with an eye for a calm, relaxing atmosphere,
comfort, big spaces with prime sea vistas and privacy within easy reach of
shopping and entertainment will definitely find them at Melon Resort, nestled
on the green slope of a hill right at the entrance to Mui Ne beach retreat
village. A circular-shaped chateau at the foot of the hill with two-storey
cottages hidden amid lush and neatly – kept tropical garden catches the eye
from a distance and obviously boasts one of the most elevated seafront
locations in whole resort village. I hop off the bus at its entrance with a
big grass lawn at the late afternoon, the very hour of the day when coastal
landscapes look mesmerizingly spectacular and sprint to the chateau-shaped
reception in hopes of catching the sunset, which coming up too fast. The
reception buildingâ€™s interior is done in noble Bordeaux and terracotta
colours, as befits a chateau, and it has a creative private collection of its
ownerâ€™s â€˜trophiesâ€™: a quaint set of knotted wooden furniture and big
snag with human silhouette, a whimsical perpetration of nature. The indoor
premises are all at the light and refreshing sea breezeâ€™s disposal,
thoughtfully divided into check-in counter, cosy lounge and spacious
restaurant with several big open-air decks, not with walls, but with levels.  
A decorative bridge across a lotus pond at the back of reception serves a
gateway to Melon Resortâ€™s landscaped hilly grounds full of trimmed exotic
shrubs growing on juicy green lawns and blooming tropical trees stretching
their branches up to the balconies of villas. Stone pathways lead uphill to
the two-storey villas and bungalows overlooking an infinity pool. At the
entrance to Premier Ocean View Room Villa, I even have to walk on stone steps
built in the pond full of cheery golden fish. The room where Iâ€™m booked
pleasantly surprises with its spaces and pleases the eye with tasteful and
creative interior decoration; deep muted red-to-dark orange wallpapers above a
king-sized bed framed with beautiful lamps, wood-laced ceiling, cooling clay-
tiled floor, kitchenette area with electric stove, kitchen cupboard equipped
with all necessary utensils and long, yet compact table with long-legged
stools. The spacious bathroom with huge glass aquarium of a shower cabin is
creatively decorated with a lively mosaic and looks out on a private mini-
garden with plants to water while taking your own shower.  
The big deck of the balcony with cosy sitting area provides a stunning view of
the vast spaces of the ocean uninterrupted, which bedazzles the spectator from
the first second and makes it extremely hard to tear the eye away even for a
dip in the swimming pool at the twilight prospect. The contemplating of the
ocean with picturesque fishing boats gliding on its enormous canvas can be
continued from the infinity pool on the top of the hilly terrain. The point of
its elevation visually aligns with the horizon and it gives an amazing feeling
of levitation above the sea surface with no end, right in the huge reservoir
of swimming pool. The option of celebrating the unusual sea sensation with a
glass of tropic cocktail is immediately available with Aeroplane pool bar
being at oneâ€™s outstretched hand.  
Melon Resort is Korean-owned and run so meticulously; the attention to
details, well-trained staff and cordial approach to resortâ€™s guests are all
present here, as well as a Korean flair at the restaurant, offering
interesting options of a multi-coloured fusion of Vietnamese seafood galore
with Korean traditional culinary delights; burned rice with water in a clay
pot included to combine with good wine from an extensive list from the
restaurant cellar. The courteous and attentive Korean manager is somehow
present at all tables at once, giving insightful advice on the food on offer.  
62 spacious and well-equipped rooms with creative interior solutions,
featuring different, colourful styles provide cosy and warm atmospheric
accommodations, featuring Deluxe, Villa, Premier Villa and Bungalow rooms, all
of them boasting spectacular ocean views and all the amenities for a smooth
and relaxing stay.  
Conveniently located in the vicinity of Mui Ne main sights such as the ancient
Cham Towers, the ruins of the old French castle and Phan Thiet seaside town
with picturesque piers with lines of small brightly-painted fishing vessels
moored to them, Melon resort provides every opportunity to connect to Mui Ne
and reward one with a more authentic experience of a place.  
The sandy beach and Sea Links golf field are five minutesâ€™ ride by hotel
buggies available immediately upon request. The beach boasts unrivalled sea
views that few other resorts on the shoreline can offer.

Garlic in Ly Son Island,  
Quang Ngai Province. _Photo: Bach Ngoc Anh_

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Ly-son.jpg)_

In recent years, a number of newspaper articles have been written about Ly
Son, which often stated that Ly Son, Quang Ngai Province is a â€˜spiritual
kingdom,â€™ â€˜garlic kingdom,â€™ and an â€˜island of civilizationsâ€™.  
According to the information from the administration of Ly Son, about 3,000
years ago, prehistoric people of the Sa Huynh culture lived on Ly Son Island.
Next, the Champa civilization developed at the beginning of the Common Era
until around the end of the sixteenth century, when Vietnamese people founded
a village on the island.  
Materials from the Ly Son Cultural Office relate that the area of Ly Son
Island is only 9.97km2, but it has over fifty religious and folk architectural
structures, among them three national heritage sites. Perhaps because of the
dense concentration of places of worship, whether I was in the residential
area, went up the terrace fields, or down to the desolate seashore, I always
came across ancient community houses, Buddhist pagodas, and shrines. The
landscape everywhere is steeped in spirituality and, moreover, in the words of
an elder, â€˜Every week there seems to be a ceremony or festival,â€™ which
made me feel that the over 20,000 Ly Son people have as much spiritual
devotion as do the people of India.  
Meanwhile, the title â€˜garlic kingdomâ€™ is easily understood if tourists
come to Ly Son on the occasions of planting, caring for, or harvesting garlic.
When I went to Ly Son between the garlic seasons (between the first month and
the second month of lunar calendar), I saw that up to 90 per cent of the area
of the terrace fields in Ly Son were verdant with garlic leaves. Wherever I
went, I heard people discussing garlic. An 80-year old elder said that the
garlic growing trade has been in Ly Son for a long time. Perhaps that is why
garlic is a part of Ly Son peopleâ€™s lives and culture. This is clearly in
their daily foods and ancestral offerings, which are all deeply infused with
the colour and scent of garlic. Mr Bay, who is over 60 years old and already
knew how to grow garlic since he was little, related, â€˜Ly Son garlic is
valuable because it is planted in sand from the ocean and watered with
slightly salty water.â€™

_  
Information in the press about places for swimming in the sea at Ly Son is
almost nonexistent. When I went up to Ly Sonâ€™s Dock the second time, I
continuously asked the local people about the most ideal place for swimming in
the sea. â€˜Hang Cau is the nicest place for swimming in the ocean,â€™ a man
named Muoi said.  
Muoi further related that Hang Cau is on the east of the island, right next to
the foot of the highest mountain, Mt. Thoi Loi, which belongs to Dong Village
of An Hai Commune. Following the directions of a 50-year old man, a friend and
I rented a motorcycle for the price of VND150,000 per day and then departed
from the dock. In only fifteen minutes, after passing residential areas so
dense that they seemed like cities and verdant terrace fields of garlic, we
arrived.  
Wanting to go into Hang Cau, we went through a narrow path a few meters wide,
between a stone peak and the sea. Meanwhile, the surrounding desolate
landscape made me feel that it was quite mysterious.

**  
At Quang Ngai bus station, every 45 minutes, a bus departs the station to go
to Sa Ky Harbour. Sa Ky Harbour is 22km east of the city of Quang Ngai,
following National Highway 24B.  
Every day, only one high-speed boat leaves from Sa Ky Harbour at 7:30-8:00,
and goes to Ly Son in just over an hour at a ticket price of VND150,000.  
Ly Son has 6-7 inns for people at a price of VND150,000-VND200,000 per room
per night, depending on the time. Nearly all the inns have a motorcycle rental
service from VND120,000 to VND150,000 per day.**

Hang Cau is composed of a rock cliff 40m high, 100m long, curved like a
horseshoe and hugs a sandy shore of proportionate length. The width of the
sandy shore as calculated from the foot of the cliff to the edge of the water
is approximately 40m. It has a lot of moss-covered small pebbles and rocks.  
Hang Cau is the most ideal beach for swimming. It can be thus concluded
because I have gone all over the Ly Son seacoast and saw nothing but rocky
dales.  
My friend immediately took off his shirt and then plunged into the small waves
that incessantly crashed against the shore. He dove into the clear water,
shouting â€˜Fantastic!â€™ â€˜Wonderful!â€™  
A man named Quang, whose home is 500m from Hang Cau, related, â€˜Thirty or
forty years ago, the fish in this place were innumerable, so many people came
to fish them. Moreover, the structure of the cliff resembles the jaws of a
frog, so the people here called it â€˜â€˜Hang Cauâ€™â€™.â€™

11/20/2019,A short jungle trek on Con Dao,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/a-short-jungle-trek-on-con-dao/,,Text and photo by Pip de Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_2907---Con-Dao.jpg,"_(No.9, Vol.4,Oct-Nov 2014 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_2907---Con-Dao.jpg)_  
View from the pavilion at So Ray, formerly a plantation worked by Vietnamese
political prisoners

So Ray is a fruit and vegetable plantation hacked out of the jungle on a
plateau, rising 210 metres above sea level on Con Dao’s main island. It was
cleared by prisoners of the French settlement to supply the tables of their
captors. Looking half way up the mountains above the island’s little town of
Cay Bang you can spot a blue pavilion. This marks So Ray.  
We were a party of three. My fourteen-year-old daughter and her nineteen-year-
old cousin were joining me. We set out from our beach front hotel, deciding to
walk the two kilometres along a quiet country lane to the base of So Ray.
Whilst this was a day to be close to nature, you cannot escape Con Dao’s grim
past as a penal colony. On the outskirts of town, we passed what was â€˜The
Cow Shedâ€™. As it name implies, in this prison, inmates were treated like
animals. Just across the way, there is a sign with explanation in Vietnamese
and English, marking the place of execution of prisoners, including twenty-two
buried alive after a mass break out.  
But soon, we were in the country, passing grazing brown cows and lakes covered
with blooming red lotus flowers. We visited the National Park Headquarters
Visitors Centre, which has an excellent exhibition on the fauna to be found on
Con Dao, including a rare Dugong (Sea Cow), preserved in formaldehyde in a
tank. Then, back on the road, there were glimpses of the endemic Con Dao black
squirrel frolicking in the trees.  
We reached the base of the track up to So Ray and there had been changes since
I made my two previous ascents. On the positive side, you can now climb up
directly after having had breakfast. A bright sparklingly clean villa has been
converted into the So Ray Guest House. Less happily, the sign board which
previously had announced the British Petroleum-sponsored So Ray project had
changed. This project was designed to save rare species of flora after the
havoc wreaked by Typhoon Linda in 1997, which destroyed swathes of the jungle.
The sign now threatened â€˜No Ticket, No Entryâ€™. I had been unaware that
this was considered part of the National Park. If you want a walk up a jungle
pathway, there are plenty of places to have this experience without paying. On
the other hand, contributing to the upkeep of Con Dao’s natural beauty is a
noble act. We would have been willing to buy our tickets, but there was no one
there to get them from and we were not going back to the Headquarters on foot
to do so. So we just carried on regardless.  
I would not advise going up if it has been raining. It will be more slippery
and the first section will turn into a stream. It was under such conditions
when I walked up the second time. That time I was lucky and I was amazed to
see, so far from the beach, a large crab. In those days, information was hard
to come by, but this time I had noted in the Visitor centre that there are two
species of forest crab on Con Dao.  
Justification for charging for the climb could be the four boards along the
way that give information. One, for example, explains that trees that grow on
mountains have long roots that lie shallow in the soil so as to anchor them
well. Certainly some of these huge roots provided seats for rest stops.
Another explains that you are in the richest biome on the planet. This may be
so, but one tree looks just like another and you will hear a variety of bird
chatter but the feathered friends are pretty good at hiding themselves. The
most common sight is skinks basking on rocks. I tried to photograph these
beautiful creatures with their golden backs and bluish tails, but they always
shot off at the last moment. One jungle sound that I enjoy is that of the
Tokay lizard – tac ke, tac ke is the cry that gives it its onomatopoeic
Vietnamese name.  
Basically, this walk is like going up a tube of greenery. You almost feel as
if you are wearing the jungle. There are no views. You are simply enveloped by
nature. The way is steep and winding. I found it heavy on the legs and the
girls, too unused to any kind of walking, had to rest frequently. Suddenly,
light comes shining through above you and you know, thankfully, you are near
the top. At this point, we heard the whooping of monkeys. I had met them on my
first visit. They had come out to meet me at this point. I was hoping this
time they would keep their distance.  
We had a long rest and finished drinking our water on seats around a picnic
table at the top. Then we walked along a path and climbed steps up to the
balcony of the pavilion. Our forty-minute climb was rewarded by superb views
of the town below and seven of the archipelago’s islands gleaming in the azure
ocean.

**Basically, this walk is like going up a tube of greenery.  
You almost feel as if you are wearing the jungle.  
**

Then my daughter cried â€˜a monkey is coming!â€™ Sure enough, a handsomely
bearded male was climbing the stairs. I was just wondering why when it grabbed
a plastic bag we had left in the corner of the balcony. There was nothing in
it but fruit, empty plastic bottles and a packet of potato crisps but I felt
indignant at having been robbed. After some moments of disbelief, I followed
it down to the jungle edge. The monkey inside of me came out as I grunted and
grimaced at it, brandishing the hotel umbrella I had been using as a staff for
leverage. It fell back and I saw that this was a family of four monkeys. There
were Mum, Dad and two kids.  
These monkeys have not lost their fear of man, but as I read on the Internet
about foolish people bringing bananas up here, they may soon do so. I found my
bag. It seems the monkey had made the same poor dietary choice as some people
did .He left the fruit and gobbled up the crisps. These monkeys are unique to
Con Dao. They are one of ten sub species of Long Tailed Macaques. Another name
for them is the Crab Eating Macaque, though this now should be changed to Poca
Eating. Another name is even more curious. It is Cynomolgous Monkey, which
means â€˜dog milkerâ€™. I learned that they have been on Con Dao a long time.
Eighteen million years in fact!  
I advised the youngsters that whilst going down was going to be lot less
exhausting, they needed to be very careful. Whilst I managed to keep upright,
my daughter did slip a couple of times. Once back on the road, I decided to
walk back the other way and make a circular route back. But it was too much
for the girls, so we stopped at a cafe. We took much-needed refreshment and
called for a taxi. We arrived back at the hotel having worked up a very good
appetite for lunch.  
I can highly recommend to you this half-day walk on your list of things to do
on Con Dao. Please respect nature if you do, especially leaving the monkeys
well alone and buy your ticket before. You may not be as lucky as we were.
Happy trekking!

Inside Dark Cave

Entrance of Dark Cave

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/A5.jpg)_  
Riding a zip line crossing Chay River

Dark Cave is about 20 kilometres from Phong Nha Cave, Quang Binh Province, by
road. Examined by British Royal explorers in 1990 and 1992, its entry way is
20 metres wide and 40 metres high. The cave is 5,258 metres long, and the
ceiling inside is up to 80 metres high. Like many other caves in Phong Nha –
Ke Bang area, it has a dry part and a submerged part. The darkness inside the
cave is thick, much thicker than in other caves. So thick that one feels one
can scoop it. Thatâ€™s why people call it the Dark Cave.  
Visitors can get on a boat at Phong Nha landing on Son River, go upstream and
then follow Chay River for about five kilometres to reach the Dark Cave. Or,
from Dong Hoi City to Phong Nha – Ke Bang Heritage Centre, it takes 40 minutes
to drive on the fabulous Ho Chi Minh trail. The Zip Line entertainment park is
17 kilometres from there. Then I and my friends rode a zip line over the Chay
River and took a boat to Dark Cave.  
The entry is a mysterious narrow hollow in a gigantic lime stone mass. When we
went inside, darkness immediately enveloped us. Without the stairs and a
guide, few would dare to come in.  
We admired a big stalagmite standing guard at the entrance, with a wavy
surface covered by tiny, glittering grains. We found fossilized shells in the
cave walls. There was even a fish skeleton high above. We had to climb up a
large rock to see it in its entirety.  
The deeper we went, the darker it became, and the more fascinating. We
followed a section of a cave river, wading waist-deep in cold water, and then
turned to another path to walk in mud. Nobody would expect such a path amidst
stone walls. Amazing! It was very narrow; at times the bottom was just wide
enough for our feet. Mud covered the walls and stalactites. The path zigzagged
for about 10 minutes, and we came to a wide area, with soft, fine mud that
thickly covered the slopes, allowing us to slide like kids, then splash into a
muddy ditch. We yelled like kids and let the mud cover us from head to toe.
â€˜Nothing anywhere can compare to this muddy joy,â€™ Pon, a foreign tourist
exclaimed. He and his pal had a specialized camera. One snapped continuously
while the other slid and fell and splashed.  
At the end of the muddy path we cheered loudly again, seeing another muddy
hole about 20 metres in diameter. Again, sliding and falling, eagerly and
wildly. The mud penetrated our skin, feeling like an elixir of life. We turned
off all the lights on our helmets to enjoy the primeval darkness and the
silence, disturbed only by dripping water.  
After a few minutes of soaking in the mud, we turned to another path that led
to the Thuy Tien pool. It was quite big, with clear, cool water. On the other
side of the pool there was a passage, about two metres wide, leading to a
submerged interstice. We dived through it and emerged to a field of rugged
rocks. We sat there for a while, enjoying the air, the absolute silence and
the perilous beauty of the rocks, and then went back, finishing the
exploration of the Dark Cave to join sportive games that take place on Chay
River.  
For a long time, people said that Phong Nha – Ke Bang is like a beautiful
woman that one can only look at, without touching. Thatâ€™s because monotonous
sight-seeing was the only thing available here. Lately, some tour companies
have ventured into the realm of adventure tourism with considerable success.  
Last August, zip line, a daring sport, appeared in Phong Nha – Ke Bang for the
first time. Tourists can cable slide 400 metres from the wildlife watch
station to Dark Cave, and slide further to a creek bath site. To guarantee
safety for guests, Phong Nha – Ke Bang tourist centre has hired three
Vietnamese mountain climbers to train mountain climbing and cable sliding
here. Since the opening of zip line services, the area has become much
livelier. Every day it receives on average 60-80 tourists, mostly foreign.  
According to Mr Le Thanh Loi, Phong Nha – Ke Bang tourist centreâ€™s director,
his centre will soon invest in the Chay River and Dark Cave area to create
more attractions such as a suspension bridge or homestead eco tourism, so
tourists will have a more in-depth experience of this land of caves.

Reinforcing a stone jetty

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/cao-bang2.jpg)_

From Cao Bang city centre, following the smooth asphaltic zigzags of the
National Highway no. 3, Ms Truong Ha, a local reporter, and I came to Pac
Rang, a unique village in Phuc Sen Commune, Quang Uyen District. We turned
right to a concrete road among yellow corn, green vegetables and gray rocks,
and the traffic noise quickly was reduced, replaced by the clanging of
hammers, puffing of bellows and sizzling of hot iron in water. Iron forging is
a traditional trade of the Nung An ethnicity here.  
Walking around the village under the shade of indigo-dyed cloths, we were most
amazed to see that Pac Rang was so neat compared to most ethnic villages in
the northern mountains, with concrete or brick paved streets, just like city
sidewalks, a clean water supply system that serves every household, a garbage
collection system, a big drainage system, and no humans living right above the
animals.  
Seeing a pretty, stilted house that leans on a rock wall and looks out to the
plain fields, we entered its gates. A middle-aged man stopped hammering his
unfinished knife to warmly invite us into the house. He was Long Van Hai, Pac
Rang village chief. He made tea for us and called his wife Trieu Thi Dan to
come out to receive the guests. His house, with stone walls outside, wooden
floor, ying-yang tile roof, and mixed mud-hay partitioning walls inside, was
built in 1996. Now it had acquired the beautiful sheen of time. It was one of
the five stilted houses invested in by the Executive Committee of the
Sustainable Tourism Development of the Extended Sub-Mekong Region of Cao Bang
Province for community tourism. I was quite fascinated to see a house in such
a remote place that had a clean and neat bathroom, with a mirror, a comb,
towels, shampoos and shower creams.  
We were the first guests on whom our host had a chance to practice their
hospitality skills. The husband lovingly showed us the secrets of iron
forging, from selecting the steel of a car shock absorber, to hammering and
tempering successively and continuously for ninety minutes to make a black,
beautiful and sharp knife that would last at least fifteen years. A Nung An
man that can not forge iron is considered useless. His wife related every
detail of cotton planting, harvesting, threading, weaving, dyeing, sewing and
embroidering to make a set of brocades that will last more than ten years and
costs three million dong for men and six million for women.

Forging iron tools

Then he took us to the fields in front of the house to show us the stone
jetty. Nung people build terraces to plant rice, so they take care not to let
the land slide. â€˜An upper terrace owner has to build a jetty to hold his
land, the lower terrace owner in turn does the same for his land. That way,
everybody protects his land and water to grow rice, corn and beans,â€™
explained Long Van Chien, while reinforcing his jetty. Highland people collect
stones, big and small, assemble them like a jigsaw puzzle to make them fit
each other, then mortar the wall with dirt or cement. These walls stand strong
against buffalo butts and the weather for centuries, not only to protect the
terraces, but also as a unique cultural feature.  
When we came back, dinner was ready on a straw mat spread in front of the
house. Ms Dan had prepared for us all the smells and tastes of local
specialties: steamed grilled pork, stir-fried beef with forest vegetables,
pork BBQ and fried fish from a nearby creek. Having exotic food and drinks and
a conversation with hospitable and simple-hearted Nung An folks amidst the
mountains was something to remember. At nightfall, we mingled with a group of
artists and the villagers in their traditional songs and dances.  
The development project, sponsored by Asian Development Bank, aims at helping
the local communities that have potential to develop ecotourism and community
tourism in order to eliminate poverty step by step. Pac Rang village had 51
households, with over 400 Nung An ethnic persons. They lived in an area of
167,000 square metres for many generations. Surrounded by high mountains,
stilted houses grouped together among paddy fields, creeks and a water mine,
it creates an idyllic, peaceful scenery. The people here have the trades of
iron forging, stonework and weaving, and many unique songs and dances. In
early 2009, Pac Rang was officially chosen to be the first community tourist
attraction of Cao Bang Province.  
The first obstacle the committee had to overcome was the problem with
livestock. Ms Nhan Thi Minh Thi, deputy head of the Department of Culture and
deputy director of the development project, still shudder at their first
impression of five years before. The Nung An used to use the space under the
floor to keep working tools, firewood and livestock. The floor is where all
the living activities take place. Humans and animals were separated only by a
layer of wooden or bamboo boards. The animals ate, defecated and pissed on the
ground, then walked and lied down on it all. Year after year, layers of filth
accumulated. Ms Thi recalls, â€˜The stench was permanent in the village. Flies
and mosquitoes swarmed around. Everybody had to cover their nose. When we
proposed to move the livestock away for better hygiene, the reaction was
overwhelming. â€˜This is our way for generations.â€™ â€˜You canâ€™t separate
us from our livestock, what if bad guys steal them to sell in China?â€™ We had
to slowly answer their questions, explaining bit by bit. The projectâ€™s
executive committee built each family a house with two rooms to keep the
animals, but the next time we came, they were still beneath the floor. We
asked why the animals were not moved, they said because they were too tired or
too busy. So we took off our shoes, rolled up our sleeves, put on hygiene
masks and waded in to the ankle-deep faeces to clean it up. It took us nearly
a year! Now all the households have a separate livestock houses and a clean
ground under the floor. What a feat!â€™  
Having cleaned up under the floors, the project built for each family
peripheral facilities, including a shower room, an autolytic toilet, a bio-gas
chamber for animal excrement, and gave them a gas stove that was cleaner and
that freed them from having to collect firewood in the forest. Then we invited
the Vietnam Project Management Consulting Company to plan a community tourist
destination at blacksmith village Pac Rang for 2005. The plan included a two-
storey village cultural centre with over 120 square metres for communal
activities and artefact exhibition, with computers connected to the internet.
Then, we built parking spaces, sport courts for the villagers, concrete and
brick roads, connected clean water supply pipes to every house and a smoke
outlet for every furnace. The projectâ€™s most important activity was skill
improvement for the community. The project executive committee opened
hospitality skill classes for the folks and a crash English class for 20
persons.  
Ms Thi said, â€˜The project was conducted from 2009 to 2013, with a nearly 12
billion dong ($571,428) investment. Right now, five among 56 households are
ready to receive tourist guests. We donated to each family four sets of
blankets, pillows, mattresses and bed sheets to encourage them to offer
services to guests. We helped them to build the price list: VND40,000
($1.90)/meal/person and VND60,000 ($2.86)/bed/night. We helped them print info
sheets and bulletins to distribute at domestic and international tourist fairs
to promote this new destination. We will also help them to create a fund, to
extract a part of the revenue to reinvest in community development.â€™

**A forest devastated by Agent Orange makes a comeback  
**

I had yet to put on my lifejacket before the 40-horsepower motorboat took off
from the pier, accelerating so quickly that it split apart the waterâ€™s
surface on the undulating river amidst a vast, saltmarsh jungle. The wind blew
fiercely against me, tossing the hair of three fellow travellers, who were
watching birds up in the immense sky. â€˜This river is about 500 meters across
and 7 meters deep,â€™ said the man steering the motorboat.  
The four-seat motorboat glided across the waves for 15 minutes. â€˜Weâ€™ve
arrived at the conservation area for the greater Asiatic yellow bat,â€™
announced the man at the motorboatâ€™s helm.  
A woman , who was waiting for us on the riverbank, invited us to get in a
four-person rowboat. She explained, â€˜Now weâ€™ll go see the bats. In order
to keep quiet, we have to use a rowboat.â€™  
After rowing the boat on a canal that lay amidst dense mangrove roots that
jutted up a whole meter above the ground, the guide said, â€˜Thatâ€™s the
place where the bats sleep.â€™ We all looked up and saw a bunch of bats
hanging in the treetops of several tens of adjoining jungle trees. â€˜During
the day they gather in one place to sleep like that. Come nightfall, they fly
off together in search of food, and they bedazzle the eyes,â€™ a woman about
35 years old informed us.

Tang Bong Tower

When we got to within about 15 meters of the bats, several of them opened
their wings and flew out. â€˜Many of the bats are as heavy as a kilogram with
a wingspan longer than a meter. In 1999, there were almost 3,000 bats here,
but people have been trapping them in nets and catching hawks, snakes, weasels
and owls, so only about 300 bats remain,â€™ we were told.  
Leaving the bat conservation area, the motorboat proceeded to rip across the
river for 10 minutes before arriving at the Vam Sat Forest Tourism Area
Centre. A guide named Tuan greeted us and introduced the place, â€˜The Vam Sat
Tourism Area is a jungle 1,862 hectares in expanse, which has many canals, and
lies in the heart of the Can Gio saltmarsh jungle biosphere reservation zone,
which has an area of 75,740 hectares. The Vam Sat Forest Tourism Centre was
recognized by the World Tourism Organization as one of the most stable
ecological tourism areas. Thirty years ago, Vam Sat was just a â€˜deadâ€™
jungle because of the American armyâ€™s toxin Agent Orange. The American army
dropped a total of 1,027,515 gallons of wilderness-clearing chemicals. With
such an overkill amount of toxins over such a small area, they turned the
pristine jungle into a devastated barren field. The forested area that
remained after the war was a mere 4,500 hectares. However, through the
peopleâ€™s efforts from 1978 to 1999, it has fully recovered to its original
condition.â€™  
According to the assessments of scientists from within Vietnam and abroad, the
Can Gio Jungle underwent the best sort of restoration, care, and protection in
the world. As for the people of Ho Chi Minh City, they liken the Can Gio
Jungle to a â€˜lungâ€™ with the function of cleaning the atmosphere and, at
the same time, a â€˜kidneyâ€™ that purifies industrial wastewater. â€™  
As we climbed up several hundred stairs to get to the top of Tang Bong Tower,
which is made of iron and is 26 meters tall, we saw that the material
foundation of the entire tourism area beneath the jungle canopy was made
primarily of trees and leaves, including the guesthouses, restaurants,
offices, and even the suspension bridges that hung precariously over the
narrow canals. About 500 [meters] away from the tower was the major river that
twisted around the verdant expanse. Peering out into the distance in all four
directions, we beheld the lushness of the Can Gio jungle for as far as the eye
could see.  
On the way to the crocodile nursery area, a pack of about 30 monkeys ran out
of nowhere and surrounded us. Escaping from the band of voracious monkeys, we
arrived at the crocodile nursery, a 1,000 m2 stretch of forest with a pond in
the middle and enclosed by a steel fence. â€˜There are currently 46 crocodiles
here that are up to a quintal in weight,â€™ Tuan informed us before going on
to explain to several dozen listening visitors about the incubation process
and cultivation of captive crocodiles in a semi-wild environment.  
Tuan instructed us to get on a composite boat surrounded by a steel wire net
and then rowed out to the centre of the lake. Within an instant, about 15 huge
crocodiles came from the shore, plunged into the water, and encircled the
boat, which made me feel as if I were tempting death. Perhaps noticing that
everyone was all astir, Tuan reassured us, â€˜The boat is surrounded by a very
safe steel net. The crocodiles cannot breach it.â€™  
Tuan waved some bait a meter above the waterâ€™s surface and a massive
crocodile immediately lunged up and snapped it off. The bite was so strong
that its two jaws of jagged teeth clamped together, creating a loud crunch
that made the visitors who were standing on the bank ooh and aah.  
For lunch that day, we sat down in a spacious restaurant and ate VND35,000
rice dishes. The menu had lots of specialties that the tourist manager said
were picked and hunted in the Can Gio forest. The most representative dishes
were baked milk oysters, giant mudskipper salad eaten with â€˜kim kimâ€™
leaves, sesame roasted triple-notched crab, salt roasted Can Gio crab,
compressed rice with pineapple-roasted fish, and assorted jungle vegetables
steamed and dipped in dry salted fish brine.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSCN1117.jpg)_

Once our stomachs were stuffed, some people rented VND15,000 hammocks to rest
beneath the trees. Meanwhile, we fooled around with yellow cheeked gibbons and
deer, which may have lived in a semi-wild environment but were quite hardy.
Next, we wandered around the winding narrow paths amidst innumerable trees
whose gnarled roots popped out of the earth.  
At 14:00, we began to view the birds by going to the conservation aviary,
which was also called the â€˜Avian Courtyard,â€™ just 500 meter on the jungle
path away from Tang Bong Tower.  
Documents from the Vam Sat Tourism Area indicate that the saltmarsh jungle
area was a 602ha expanse with a core area of 126ha. It was a place for
cultivating types of plants like date palm Indian mangrove, beansprouts,
mallows and ferns and for raising about 7,000 living species of birds, the
most representative of which were the jabiru white egret, milky stork, cattle
egret night heron, cormorant and Oriental darter.  
After climbing the 10m high tower that lay in the middle of the Avian
Courtyard, we gazed all around and saw several hundred winged birds gliding
across as their cries resounded above. The verdant jungle floor and many
stretches of forest were stained white from the birdsâ€™ defecation.  
â€˜Now there are few birds. If you guys came during the months from May to
October, then youâ€™d see all kinds of birds flying densely above the Avian
Courtyard with deafening cries and thereâ€™d be innumerable nests atop the
trees,â€™ intimated Ho Thi Ngoc Nhu, the manager of the Vam Sat Tourism Area.  
After five hours in Vam Sat, we got into the motorboat and returned to the
pier to pick up our motorcycles for the back to Saigon. If we had wanted to
stay the night, we couldâ€™ve slept in rooms at 300,000Ä‘ for two persons per
night.

**How to get there:  
** _– Take bus no.20 at the station in front of Ben Thanh Market to get the
Binh Khanh ferry.  
– After crossing the river, take bus no.90 which runs the line from Binh Khanh
to Can Thanh.  
– Get off at Dan Xay Bridge and buy a ticket at VND485,000 per person for a
Vam Sat tour. The price includes the services  
in the article; only the rice dishes needed to be paid for separately._

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSCF4035.jpg)

More than four hours on a bus from Saigon, I and a dozen people stopped at Cat
Tien Farm Stay, Dong Nai Province. Cat Tien Farm Stay is not a place for those
who love relaxing in hotels with luxurious amenities or modern architecture.
Cat Tien Farm Stay has more than a dozen simple rooms and three bungalows
around a garden full of durian, rambutan, grapefruit, cashew nut and chilli
trees. The river flowing slowly, the wind playing in the bamboo leaves, and
the cicadas singing in the trees all made me feel such peace that I did not
want to think of anything except for taking a nap on a hammock hanging in the
garden.  
After being treated to a Northern Vietnamese lunch in the garden, we went to
Ta Lai longhouse. There were two options; ride a bicycle on a 15-kilometre
route with countryside scenes, or to go by car and then walk the last two
kilometres across an ethnic village. We walked across a suspension bridge and
through a village of Ma and Sâ€™tieng people. The quiet village featured two
rows of small brick houses of the same size and model and were built by the
government to encourage ethnic people to emigrate there. Ta Lai longhouse was
on the top of a hill, overlooking a lake and on the border of Cat Tien
National Park. The longhouse is a 52 square metre traditional bamboo stilt
house with capacity for 30 people. It cost VND450,000 per person per night. Ta
Lai longhouse organizes adventure tours to the jungle and camping trips for
children from June to August.

**Go to Mien Dong Bus Station and buy a ticker at counter number 5 for xe Kim
Hoan at VND85,000. The bus will take around 4 hours and 30 minutes to travel
from Ho Chi Minh City to Cat Tien  
National Park.**

We went kayaking on the lake covered with water lily and lotus flowers. Flocks
of butterflies flew around. Birds sang songs in the trees. The view was so
beautiful and serene and the air was so fresh. Our kayak moved slowly in the
lake and we enjoyed a rare moment which is difficult to catch in the hustle
and bustle of Saigon.  
Back at Cat Tien Farm Stay, it was so interesting bathing in a large open
bathroom with a river and forest backdrop. I felt closer to Mother Nature. I
could see everything happening outside. Dark clouds came together in the sky.
The wind started to blow and the trees shook wildly. Later in the evening, we
had a barbecue dinner in the dim light in the garden amidst a light drizzle. I
felt warm because of Gary and the attendantsâ€™ enthusiasm for serving. Gary
is from Malaysia and is one of the owners of Cat Tien Farm Stay. He is a
nature-lover, and I can feel his passion through his stories with and his
excited voice and bright eyes.  
The rain had abated, so I went outside for a walk. Unlike a noisy and busy
city, the area around the Farm Stay was sunk in darkness and quiet. The road
only had some lights from the local desert stall accompanied by the melancholy
sounds of crickets and frogs. It made me remember my childhood in those days
when my village was usually in darkness because of no electricity.  
The next morning, I gaped at a large number of dead mayflies in the sink and
on the ground. I hurried to change my clothes and took a bicycle. Gary had
said that with a big jungle and orchard plantations surrounding us, the air is
cool and fresh in the early morning, so I did not want to miss a chance to
check it out. I stopped at a field with hills in the distance, took a deep
breath of fresh air and felt the warmth of sunrays. The new day began full of
energy. Following the guides, I rode to a local market, which was crowded in
the early morning, and found the road to the pagoda for meditation. However I
did not find any pagoda on the road. Gary smiled and said that the pagoda was
located in the narrow alley in the village.  
We visited Cat Tien Jungle Lodge, which will launch in November, 2014, before
trekking to the jungle. The Jungle Lodge has a great view of Dong Nai River
and the Cat Tien National Park. The hotel offers comfortable and spacious
accommodation for more 90 people with a selection of rooms, bungalows, suites
and tents. Also, the hotel has meeting rooms, a restaurant, cafÃ©, spa, a bar
and bird-watching area. Certainly, it is for those who love not only adventure
trips but also luxurious hotels.  
Obeying the instructions of a guide, I covered my trousers with a pair of long
socks and wore a sport shoes to protect from an invertebrate called váº¯t,
which has its shape of a rubbery worm, and is about two centimetres long. The
guide said váº¯t appeared a lot after a rain; they could know it was time to
feed because of the temperature. So you kept moving continuously. If you
stayed in one place for a few minutes, váº¯t would latch onto your shoes and
would stick on your body and suck out blood.  
According to the website of United Nation Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), Cat Tien National Park is classified as a reserve of
natural resource in Vietnam with lots of rare, special and endemic fauna and
flora, and a site for scientists, domestic and foreign tourists. The natural
area of Cat Tien National Park is 71.920 ha wide. Cat Tien National Park is
part of the wet tropical forest complex and one of the few rare natural
forests remaining in Vietnam. The diversity of the park has been recognized by
WWF when it selected the park as one of 200 global ecological zones.  
According to the brochure of the Cat Tien National Park, the park has 14
nature discovery activities, based on low, medium and high difficulty of the
trails within the park. There are other activities, like taking a boat on Dong
Nai River, watching mammals at the night, bicycling and visiting animals
rescue centres.  
We left the main road and discovered a three-kilometre trail to two giant Tung
trees, which are hundreds of years old. The trail was narrow and slippery,
surrounded by of a lot of trees. The guide showed us the giant Tung Tree. Its
trunk was very straight with its roots that looked like walls sprouting from
the ground and spreading over a wide area. The forest was noisy with our
conversation and the sounds of birds and insects. Suddenly, we heard the sound
of a gibbon. The guide excitedly pointed to a gibbon in the top of the tree in
a distance and said that the male gibbon was trying to attract the females. It
was a pity we did not bring a pair of binoculars so we could see the majestic
male gibbon more clearly as it swung about at the canopy. Finally, we finished
the trek and checked for váº¯t on our clothes, shoes, hair and bodies. Many
váº¯t fell on the ground. Someoneâ€™s foot was bleeding. The others were
bitten on the belly and back. The wounds did not stop bleeding for a while. On
the way back to the entrance of the park, we walked by a stream and a bamboo
forest with a number of colourful butterflies.

11/20/2019,A walk to remember in Cao Bang,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/a-walk-to-remember-in-cao-bang/,,By Ha Linh Quan,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/220-Don---BAN-GIOC-THANH-BINH.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NBN062579-copy----Cao-Bang-by-Nguyen-Ba-Ngoc.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NBN063974-copy----thac-ban-gioc-Cao-Bang-by-Nguyen-Ba-Ngoc.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NBN063926-copy----Dong-Nguom-Ngao-Cao-Bang-by-Nguyen-Ba-Ngoc.jpg,"_(No.8, Vol.4,Sep-Oct 2014 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)  
_  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/220-Don---BAN-GIOC-THANH-
BINH.jpg)

There are two ways from Hanoi to Cao Bang. I and some friends chose to take
the Lang Son pass. After four hoursâ€™ ride, we had it in sight. The little
town was gliding softly towards us, like the Bang Giang River in low water
season. No big, glorious buildings; just tiny flowers on earthen walls to lure
visitorsâ€™ attention. The day was ending. The yolk of the sun, falling behind
the forest, was casting gold all over the town. Soft darkness slowly crawled
on the roofs of tiny, two-storey buildings. Talkative mother birds noisily
called their chicks home outside the innâ€™s windows.  
It was around eight the next morning. The mist still clung to the mountains,
bobbing over the valleys around the town. We hit the road to Ban Gioc Falls,
the symbol of Cao Bang Province. The unfinished road, full of pot-holes left
by heavy lorries, so muddy in the rain, made an old dog lie flat in exhaustion
and our bones clank. But the view on both sides compensated for it all. A
virgin world, grand and green, with xianmu trees growing on the rocks, stripes
of red-leafed trees in the valleys and cool yellow blankets of blossoming
buckwheat. Everything was so fresh under oblivion!  
At last, after 100 bumpy kilometres, we reached the famous Ban Gioc Falls.
Itâ€™s always a long road and some sacrifice to get near a beauty, and Ban
Gioc Falls is no exception.  
Cao Bang Geographic wrote, â€˜The river Quay Son, flowing from China to
Vietnam, splits at Ban Gioc, Dam Thuy Commune, Trung Khanh District, into many
branches and abruptly descends 35 metres, forming waterfalls with three
cascades. The nearer one gets, the more one is tantalized by its breath-taking
beauty.â€™

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NBN062579-copy----Cao-Bang-by-
Nguyen-Ba-Ngoc.jpg)_

We stood stunned below the falls, contemplating the natural aquarelle
masterpiece that only the very stupid or very talented dare to try to describe
in words. The news people got fussy with camera shots. A fellow visitor who
had seen the world-famous Niagara Falls in the US sat down on a rock and
dreamt aloud, â€˜I wish I had a house right there by the falls.â€™ Too late,
Miss; Saigon Tourist does not wish anymore. They already have a project for
building a high-standard tourist centre at Ban Gioc Falls, which started
earlier last year.

___![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NBN063974-copy----thac-ban-
gioc-Cao-Bang-by-Nguyen-Ba-Ngoc.jpg)_

After a whole afternoon at the falls, it was still hard for me to leave,
although I had already made up my mind to come back again. Walking on wet
grass to the van in the rumble of falling water, I felt a chill in my spine.
Manh Ha, Vietnam News Agency correspondent in Cao Bang tried to comfort me,
â€˜Nguom Ngao is also drop-dead gorgeous.â€™

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NBN063926-copy----Dong-Nguom-
Ngao-Cao-Bang-by-Nguyen-Ba-Ngoc.jpg)

Nguom Ngao is a large cave in a mountain at Gun village (three kilometres from
Ban Gioc). Nguom Ngao means â€˜tiger den.â€™ The British Royal cave
exploration team measured its length in 1995; 2,144 metres. Inside the cave
was a cool, miraculous world, created by the greatest sculptor-nature, with
fairies combing hair, elephants and tigers, and heaven-supporting pillars. I
even fancied a ship loaded with gold! The cave ceiling was now as high and
vast as heaven, now as low and tight as the road to the underworld. The deeper
we went, the more beautiful it was, dissipating our tiredness.  
Even Trung Thanh, a newsman who loved wandering around, and who, as a
professional adventurer, had seen some things, had to utter â€˜Oh my! Itâ€™s a
must see!â€™  
It was getting late. The fog became a drizzle, whispering within a hazelnut
grove. We had to wait till morning to go to Thang Hen. Itâ€™s a chain of 36
lakes that covers 30 ha in the mountains, at 1,000 metres above the sea level.
It was summer time, and the lakes were not as vast as our guide described. One
can oar kilometres along the chain through hundred-metre-deep caves. The water
was emerald colour.  
Two wet, tender-eyed horses grazed on the shore. A few men in straw hats were
sitting on rocks, casting their fishing lines. A boat carried people into the
forest to collect medicinal herbs, which are prevalent in the 200 ha forest
around these lakes. Purity and quietness reigned. Marigold flowers around the
lake shook their heads softly in a breeze coming from the forest, which
brought the noise of birds quarrelling in the canopy.  
Our lunch was served in a house on stilts. Gam river fish with katuk (aka star
gooseberry), black pork with forest vegetables, sticky rice with pili fruits;
it was all blissful. Only the chicken in ginger broth was as tough as an old
crowâ€™s meat. Dessert included sticky rice cakes with black ant eggs, wrapped
in young fig leaves and roasted Trung Khanh hazelnuts. Cao Bang has rice wine
with seven leaves and one flower herb steeped in it. Life would be meaningless
without having tasted a sip!  
On the way back, passing the town of Thuan Hoa, we encountered, by chance, a
festival. People gathered to pray for good weather. It was also a chance for
boys and girls to exchange feelings. So the place was full of young people of
many ethnicities. Tay girls wore black shawls, tied in the raven beak style,
and blue, self-woven and sewn dresses, so soft that the cloth bobbed with
their every step. Nung boys wore short shirts, which were cut wide open at the
chest, and had braided buttons.  
On a wide clearing, Nung boys showed off sli songs, Tay girls, then songs. I
didnâ€™t understand a word, just heard a lot of â€˜uhuâ€™ and â€˜ahaâ€™. They
also played cÃ²n and human chess games, and had martial art shows. Their
shouts made one want to join. The small kids followed the lion dance troop or
surrounded the â€˜phung xoongâ€™ (BBQ) pans.  
Pac Bo belongs to Truong Ha Commune, Ha Quang District, 40 kilometres from Cao
Bang township. I always thought it had only historical value as a cradle of
the revolution. It turned out to be stunning too. Lenin Creek, deep and full
of clear water, runs along a paved pathway, sparkling and snaking through the
rock Uncle Ho sat angling and the stone table he used while translating the
Partyâ€™s history.  
It was so quiet, I could hear the bird wings flapping in the canopy. The sun
was setting. Farmers began to drive their buffalos back home from grazing
areas in the forest. A dog followed them, stopping here and there to bark at
the carefree fishes. Nobody fishes in Lenin Creek. Itâ€™s truly a scene in a
fairy tale. On New Yearâ€™s Eve, Cao Bang people come to collect water from
this creek, much like the people in low lands collecting buds.  
Mr Hoang Anh, Chairman of the Peopleâ€™s Committee of Cao Bang province said,
â€˜Cao Bang has many beautiful caves, still secluded in oblivion.â€™ Such is
the state of Cao Bangâ€™s tourism.

With the advent of direct flights to Cam Ranh Airport and a greater
international profile, Nha Trang is fast becoming one of the most visited
cities in Vietnam. The glorious tropical climate, welcoming locals, beautiful
bay, great seafood and a laid-back way of life all contribute to its charm.
But there are two things which have really made Nha Trang world famous; its
mud baths and spas. The city boasts three mud bath resorts and a host of
excellent spas. A day soaking in a mud bath is a treat is a â€˜must doâ€™ for
any visitor to town. Similarly, a day at a high-class spa is simply a joy. One
can lay back, leave the world outside for a few hours and be pampered in
style.

In Nha Trang, there is only one place where visitors can get accommodation,
mud baths and a great spa under the one roof. That is the brand new, four-star
Galina Hotel and Spa at 5 Hung Vuong Street.  
The spa and mud bath complex takes up three levels of the hotel. In the
basement is the spacious and comfortable reception area, which sets the scene
for the rest of oneâ€™s visit. It is relaxed and user-friendly and the staff
welcomes clients with a warm smile. Aromatherapy, various massage, facials,
hair and nail care, nail art, body scrubs, foot care and pedicures, manicures,
reflexology and waxing are all offered to make it a genuine â€˜one stop
health, beauty and well-being shopâ€™. There is a kidsâ€™ games area so
parents can kick back and relax for a while.  
On one level is the mud bath treatment area with its 18 separate tubs, able to
hold up to six people. Hop into the warm therapeutic liquefied mud and either
frolic or relax for 20 minutes or so. The body tends to float in the mud
giving a sense of weightlessness. It is a real â€˜buzzâ€™ for the first time
user. There are outdoor showers under a large artificial tree nearby to clean
off and the facility is in an essentially outdoor setting. Part of it is
sheltered under a faux â€˜caveâ€™, complete with stalactites. An interesting
addition is the holes in these stalactites, presumably to attract the
Salanganese Bird, world-renowned for its nest, which is the basis for one of
Asiaâ€™s iconic dishes, birdsâ€™ nest soup.  
The area is beautifully landscaped with ferns, bamboo, shrubs, orchids and
hanging baskets with overhead shade-cloth protecting clients from the direct
sun. Views of the rugged jungle-clad mountains of the hinterland add to the
general ambience and charm.  
In the same area, there is a large sauna next to a similar-sized steam room to
sweat away the excesses of Nha Trangâ€™s famous after-dark hospitality
industry. If by some chance more hospitality is required, there is a small
cafÃ©/restaurant next to the pool and Jacuzzis offering light meals, soft
drinks, juices and arguably the citiesâ€™ finest handcrafted beers from the
local microbrewery.  
On the next level is the spa itself and the term â€˜luxuriousâ€™ is not out of
place. There are a myriad of treatment areas, including VIP-themed rooms with
Japanese, Vietnamese, Arabian and European dÃ©cor, offering the ultimate spa
experience in the city.  
Clients are looked after by experienced, fully trained and amiable staff and
therapists who treat their clients with friendship and respect, looking after
their every need. The experience is one of pure indulgence and escape. A
massage at Galina Spa is an experience not to be missed. Clients are asked if
any part of the body requires special treatment or attention and what level of
pressure they would prefer so a custom massage can be arranged.

It is not to overstate matters to say clients want for nothing at the Galina
Spa. The forethought that has gone into the design and layout of the facility,
plus the services offered, is considerable and painstaking. The well-being and
needs of the client are foremost in its planning and experienced heads have
been at work to establish a great complex.  
When you come to Nha Trang put the Galina Hotel and Spa on your â€˜to doâ€™
list. There is nothing quite like it in town and if you are an overseas
visitor on holidays, you owe it to yourself to have some glorious, self-
indulgent pampering at least once during the trip. You may not get the chance
to repeat an experience like this.

11/20/2019,First by name first by nature,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/first-by-name-first-by-nature/,,By Pip de Rouvray ,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/LU-CUA-NG.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1-2-De-nhat-ok.jpg,"_(No.7, Vol.4,Aug-Sep 2014 Vietnam Heritage Magazine,Advertorial)_

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/LU-CUA-NG.jpg)

One morning in 2001, I learned the meaning of the adage, ‘Every cloud has a
silver lining’. I was off for a weekend with my family to Nha Trang. We
suffered the misfortune of a flight cancellation. We also enjoyed the good
fortune of being accommodated at the First Hotel, only five minutesâ€™ drive
from the airport.  
The room was comfortable and the food was excellent. We spent the afternoon
relaxing in and by the expansive pool. I never forgot the pleasant experience.
So, I was intrigued when I recently received an invitation to try their buffet
lunch. I found the hotel had expanded greatly over the years, to include,
among other things, a new wing, conference facilities, wedding halls, and more
restaurants. The three-star hotel I had known has now been upgraded to a four-
star and has diversified into so much more than just a hotel.  
There was no better man to show me the changes than Sales Manager Mr Pham Dang
Quy, who has been working here since 1992.  
First and most obviously, the swimming pool which was diagonally opposite the
hotel seemed to have disappeared, with a large building replacing it. But no,
Mr Quy showed me it was still there, behind the new faÃ§ade, now in a kind of
a courtyard with outdoor tables set around it. In this pleasant setting, you
can now enjoy meals of barbecued seafood and meats. Moreover, at the entrance,
there is a patisserie where you can buy choice pastries, cakes, and breads not
generally available in the suburbs.  
Now directly opposite the original hotel is the new wing which brings the
number of rooms up to just over one hundred and fifty. A security guard will
ensure your safety in crossing the street, which is nowhere near the take-
your-life-in-your-hands experience as you find in downtown Saigon.  
Once over there, you will find a massage, sauna and beauty facility on the
ground floor, as well as a VIP spa opposite and an entertainment facility for
foreign passport holders. On the top floor, there is an atmospheric sushi
restaurant with decor to make you feel you are in a rustic Japanese tavern and
there are young Vietnamese hostesses dressed like geishas.  
The new wing has a selection of framed pictures of old Saigon in the
corridors. Each room also has pictures with local themes to make you feel that
you are truly in Vietnam. Whichever category of room you choose, from Superior
to Deluxe Suite, everything is here for your comfort; from tea and coffee-
making facilities to collectible toiletries in the immaculate bathrooms.  
All this touring was whetting my appetite, so it came as some relief when Mr
Quy led me back to the main building for a buffet lunch. He introduced me to
Mr Do Quang Long, a chef of great renown, who has won a number of prestigious
prizes. It came as music to my ears when Long suggested accompanying the food
with ice-cold draught Tiger beer. At only 22,000 dongs for a glass, this is a
bargain for a four-star hotel. I put the question to Mr Long which I ask all
chefs and which invariably evokes the same response. Mr Long is no exception.
â€˜Who cooks at homeâ€™? I asked. â€˜My wifeâ€™, came the reply.  
First up on buffet parade came the salad bar and vegetarian section. I sampled
the crinkly chips, the vegetarian spring rolls and aubergine (eggplant) fried
in garlic. Then came a formidable array of chafing dish hurdles. Unusually,
some of these housed delicacies in little saucers. Particularly savoury were
the stuffed squid and the scallop croquettes.  
Whilst this basically a Vietnamese buffet, there were two delightful dishes of
European origin, which have been absorbed into Vietnam’s infinite cuisine.
These were the chunks of beef cooked in red wine sauce and the spaghetti with
Bolognaise sauce.  
For dessert, I tried taro pudding with fresh dragon fruit and watermelon. I
might have opted for one of the flavours of freshly made ice cream, but the
calorie count did not allow it.  
You will note below that the buffets on the weekend are a tad more expensive.
This is because there are more seafood dishes in the mix.  
â€˜First impressions last foreverâ€™. That is the motto of this hotel. That is
my conclusion too. Returning after many years, I found the same core quality
business of comfortable lodgings and fine dining. Only now, it has sprouted
branches. In the airport area, this is now also the place where you are
guaranteed care and attention if you are marrying off your daughter or you
need to hold a business meeting or conference. If you enjoy Vietnamese,
Japanese or Korean foods or fancy a decent gateau you will find it here. And
if there is anyone for tennis or a dip in a long wide pool or a spa treatment,
well, it’s all here now!

Sailing to  
Ke ga Island.  
_Photo: Hoang Phuong_

Ke Ga island is only seven ha big and just 500 metres from shore, but is quite
famous, not only because it has a lighthouse that many think is the oldest in
South-East Asia, but also because it has inspired many tour organizers to come
up with attractive features such as raft rowing, rope skidding, and round
asphalt-coated bamboo basket rowing.  
Recently, for the first time, a Saigon tour company has successfully designed
a tour, in which a team of tourists make a sail raft by themselves and sail to
the island. I decided to have a small adventure.  
From the spot nearest to Ke Ga, which is in Thuan Qui Commune, Ham Thuan Nam
District, Binh Thuan Province, all 20 of us could see clearly the island with
the lighthouse in the middle, which looks like a giant chimney that thrusts
into the deep blue sky. We also saw along the coconut shaded beach some
restaurants and hotels with boat rental service. Nevertheless, we chose a more
thrilling means of getting to the island.  
We divided into two teams to make a â€˜sail boatâ€™ out of tubes, bamboo
splints, ropes and canvas that could carry 10 persons. With the guidance of
the adventure tourism specialists, it took us only 15 minutes to get ready to
sail.  
The wind was high. The sail looked like the belly of a walking beer barrel.
We, the oarsmen, lacked skill, and the raft kept turning its head. Little by
little, my team managed to control the unruly sail. Halfway there, we hit a
strong current and big waves, which made the raft bob like crazy. A tall wave
sprang onto the raft and almost knocked us down. I was feeling the adventure
now! Without the life guard boat in sight, it would be like wrestling with
death.  
After 20 minutes struggling with the waves, we set foot on the island, which
is stunted but lively, due to the multitude of rocks of all shapes and sizes
under a cloud of swallows.  
The island today is scarcely covered by rare dry bushes, but historical
records say that Ke Ga had a small creek running through a dense forest, rich
with pheasants. So people called it the Khe Ga (Pheasant Creek) island, and
then mispronounced it as Ke Ga.  
To explore the island with a myriad of rocks carved by sea waves through
thousands of years and an over a hundred-year-old lighthouse that stands
proudly under high winds and a scorching sun, each of us had to pay a
VND20,000 fee.  
We were surprised to see two rows of old plumeria plants lining the path to
the light house. The tree trunks were big and rough. â€˜There are 10 trees
each row, planted by the French over 100 years ago, roughened by the sun and
the salty winds, and age. â€˜They blossom all spring, and that is a sight to
seeâ€™, light house chief Nguyen Van Sau said.  
The tower base is an octagon; each side wall is 3m long and 1.6m thick, built
with thousands of large granite rocks, laboriously cut. I felt as if I was
standing next to an Egyptian pyramid.  
According to Southern Maritime Safety Company, which takes care of Ke Ga light
house, its height is 41m from the base. But some newspapers say that it is 35m
tall.  
Pointing to a little shrine blurred by incense, the almost 60-year-old
â€˜island lordâ€™, as we teasingly called him, said, â€˜About 90 people died
while building this lighthouse.â€™  
Old records say that about 40 years after having colonized Vietnam, seeing
that many ships and junks sank in the area around Ke Ga, the French decided to
build this lighthouse. Designed by architect Chnavat, the light house
construction began in February, 1897 and finished late in 1898.  
Inside the tower, 184 spiralling stairs, lit by numerous windows on the side
walls, lead to the top of the tower. Halfway up, sweating, my heart pounding
in my ears, I thought those with heart diseases had to be careful when going
up these stairs.  
I leaned on the bannister. The fishing village Ke Ga gleamed behind, its shore
full of fishing boats on one side. Beneath me, far down there, wave after wave
lathered the rocks around the island. On the other side, infinitely far away,
the sea and the sky mixed in a single blue misty mass. I felt so tiny.  
The â€˜lord of the islandâ€™ lives in a two storey house with metre-thick
walls, built by the French. 35 years living with the lighthouse, he had so
much to tell about loneliness of life on islands, about the times when the
â€˜eye of the seaâ€™ was shut in pitch dark nights, under raging storms.  
On the way back, we put down the sail and rowed against the wind. The
sensation was no less exciting than before.  
Before all the adventures, we had enjoyed some nice cultural activities,
courtesy of the guide.  
After six hour drive from Saigon, we checked in to four-star Mom Da Chim
Resort, on the beach of Tan Tien Commune, La Gi City, Binh Thuan Province. The
next morning, we had some Yoga practice on the beach while the red sun slowly
turned bright yellow on the dark blue sea.  
After breakfast, we went to a very sacred place which attracts pilgrims from
everywhere, a national â€˜heritage site of artistic architectureâ€™ just two
kilometres from the resort. The temple is called the Palace of His and Her
Magicality, built in 1879 in a desolate grove. There are stories full of myth
and folklore elements related to a married couple of compassionate Taoists who
possessed magical power. The 220 square metres building contained many
external and internal delicate carvings. The temple keeper told us that the
most special thing about the Palace is the set of four central pillars. They
represent the utmost perfection of the ancient woodwork.  
Not far from the temple, we stopped at a large pitahaya plantation. Thousands
of red dragon fruits stood out on the lush green of the garden. The owner
described to us the whole process from germinating, growing saplings and day-
to-day care, to harvesting. He let us pluck and enjoy the best of his fruits
right there in the garden.  
After leaving the plantation, each with a big bag of dragon fruits, we were
taken to an open-air food shop on the beach, looking toward Ke Ga Island. The
wind was cool, the seafood was fresh, the cooking was great, and we had a
generous refill of energy, ready for the rough ride to the island.

**French jazz diva soothes the savage beast  
**

Sit in the lobby of an international hotel like the Sofitel Saigon Plaza for
any length of time and you are sure to see people from all over the world and
hear many tongues. All of them have come seeking peace, rest and comfort,
confident that this is the place to find such things. May was a turbulent
month for East Asia and for Vietnam in particular. But it was also the month
when a true nightingale flew in from France in the form of Miss Gabrielle to
start her two months of soirees at the Boudoir Lounge with harmony and
melodies to soothe even the most ruffled of feathers.  
My editor and I were invited to a press preview performance. I arrived early
enough to almost bump into a gentleman carrying what appeared to be from my
angle, a flute. â€˜You must be the flautist,â€™ I enquired. â€˜No this is a
saxophone,â€™ he said, giving me a clearer view of the instrument. His name is
Giorgio Ventura and he hails from Italy. We engaged in a conversation
broaching many subjects, but the most interesting thing was that he admitted
that having only just met Gabrielle, he was not quite sure how he was going to
accompany her singing and piano playing.  
Seated at the grand piano in her stunning bright red dress, Mademoiselle
Gabrielle looked the star even before she wowed us all with a perfect
rendition of the French standard, â€˜La Vie en Roseâ€™. She went on to sing
two other familiar jazz era songs, eerily reminding one of Billie Holiday,
whom we were told is one of her heroes. Her final rendition was a song I have
long loved â€“ â€˜Autumn Leavesâ€™. This was made famous to me by one of the
most beautiful voices ever-that of Nat King Cole. His is a hard act to match,
but Gabrielle, every bit as mellifluous in English as in her native tongue,
proved to be Nat’s female peer. I had not realised she could have sung it in
French, as I now learn this song has a Hungarian-French composer and the
original title is â€˜Les Feuilles Mortesâ€™ (The Dead Leaves).  
Giorgio need not have been apprehensive. Dressed in a simple white shirt, he
was at pains not to steal the sartorial limelight from Gabrielle. The two
harmonised together intuitively and I noticed Gabrielle at times casting him
little glances of approval. Giorgio’s playing provided the perfect complement
to the piano and jazz singing. Having said that, he achieved the beautiful
chalumeau register more normally affected by the clarinet, and played so
hauntingly that it is clear the gentleman deserves a show of his own.  
Later, seated at a table with the two performers, I posed a question to
Gabrielle put forward by my editor. â€˜Are you going to learn to sing a
Vietnamese song?â€™ I asked her. Could you suggest one to me?â€™ she replied.
I proposed the much-beloved standard from my wife’s home town â€“ â€˜Mua Tren
Pho Hueâ€™. (â€˜It is raining in Hueâ€™).  
So, I strongly urge you over the remaining time that Gabrielle is in town to
book your table at the Boudoir. You and your company will be in for a
soothing, relaxing evening of easy listening delivered by a faultless diva and
pianist. In these soirees, Sofitel melds French, Italian and Vietnamese to
send a message of peaceful harmony and through the medium of music will
hopefully help to build a bridge over troubled East Asian waters.  
Gabrielle Jenselme, a French classical pianist and jazz singer, performs
nightly at Sofitel Saigon Plaza’s Boudoir Lounge until 20 July, 2014.

In April, 2013, I was invited by Vietmark Company to join them in an
exploratory tour in Binh Duong, which is 60 kilometres northeast of Saigon.
After three hours of travelling, the 40-seat bus brought us to a remote area
of Tan Dinh Commune, Tan Uyen District, Binh Duong Province. Getting off the
vehicle, we were divided into three teams, with a mountain bike for each
member. Our team had twelve, biking on a soiled path winding through many low
hills and valleys. On the sides of the path were scattered farms and barren
forests.  
The heat at 10: 30 a.m. in the middle of the dry season made us profusely damp
with sweat.  
After conquering 5.5 kilometres, we gathered to rest in a rubber forest on the
bank of the Song Be River. â€˜This river flows through three provinces: Binh
Phuoc, Binh Duong and Dong Nai, passing through forests,â€™ said the marketing
manager of Vietmark Company and master of geomorphology.  
After watching the workers collecting liquid rubber, we used trees and canvas
ropes to tie four big plastic floats five metres long into a raft. Putting on
the lifebuoys, we got on the raft and took turns to row it. We sailed along
the gentle waters of the river, which wound through the endless forests and
scattered farms on its banks.  
The river was about 200 metres in width and from 7 to 30 metres in depth; the
raft went fast when it encountered rapids. We passed through the rapids in
anxiety and joy.  
At noon, we arrived at a cashew plantation adjacent to the river, which was
2.4 kilometres from the starting point. The farm owners brought out two
chickens, a plate of raw and fresh shrimp and various vegetables. â€˜My garden
is large, it has an area of 4 ha and I have raised many chickens, so eat to
your heartâ€™s content,â€™ the host said, beaming.  
We built a fire in the middle of the cashew garden to grill the chicken and
shrimp and then ate them with bread and vegetables.  
The farm owner, named Bay, said that it was the first time he received
tourists to his farm, and then he excitedly said: â€˜You are visiting such a
deserted and remote place-what a happy day for us! From now on, if you have
any orders, Iâ€™m willing to serve dishes made from chicken raised in the
garden and fish or shrimp caught from the river.â€™  
Fully fed and contently rested on hammocks, we got on the raft again and
followed the flow downstream about 500 metres and landed on the right bank of
the river. A ways off from the river bank, we saw the Green Eye Resort with
many bungalows at the centre of a large farm.  
In reply to my question whether it was difficult for the resort to attract
guests when it was located at such an isolated region, the resort farm owner
named Nguyen Tran Khanh said: â€˜I built this because I owed this land. I used
to fight in the war here, my boot prints were left everywhere in the Ä
military zone of the forest.â€™

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/anh-2sdv.jpg)_

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/anh-1dg2.jpg)_

After introducing the resort farm with an area of 60 ha, the veteran spent
over one hour telling of many bloody battles and the cases when he narrowly
escaped from the death in the Ä military zone forest.  
Ä military zone was the headquarters of the communists in the southern
region, which was built in February 1946 in a forest in Tan Uyen District of
Binh Duong Province. Initially, Ä military zone was the command base against
the French. During the Vietnam War, Ä military zone was increasingly
expanded, including the areas of seven eastern provinces of the south. However
the war went, there were many bloody battles occurring at Ä military zone,
which earned its name as â€˜the land of deathâ€™.  
Today, Ä military zone has changed a lot, since many urban areas appeared
while few spots were preserved. The most famous preserved area was the head
centre, where many senior communist leaders had taken shelter. The centre was
about 10 kilometres from the Green Eye Resort.  
We made a tour around the farm, where many trees like rubber, trÃ´m (Sterculia
lychnophora), cassava, mango, jackfruit, papaya, and dragon fruit were
planted; animals like wild boars, stags were raised and various vegetables
were grown.  
â€˜Visitors can take care of the vegetable garden or pick the vegetables and
cook them by themselves. If they want to eat any fruits, they can fetch them
in the garden, they can choose the wild boar they want and ask the staff to
help them make the dishes,â€™ the farm manager named Phat said.  
In the afternoon, we enjoyed grilled wild boar meat with beer in a meadow near
the river bank.  
If you visit it and bring a hammock, a sleeping bag or a tourist tent along
with you, you can sleep for free in the garden, meadow or cafÃ© in the resort.

With the tropical sun plunging its glaring self into the waters of Nha Trang
Bay, the outlines of a familiar seaside city observed from a new and
unaccustomed angle from the floor-to-ceiling windows of my Grand Deluxe Room
on the 10th floor of the bright new four-star MÆ°á»ng Thanh Nha Trang Hotel,
the view took on the surprising likeness of Greece. The lines of neat, square
houses lamed in white with flat roofs and tiny gardens descending from the
juicy green hill down the sandy shore with the full city stretching along a 10
km coastline at the distance gradually looked like something one could imagine
while reading about a magic music box or old street organ from Andersen fairy
tales. After long years of staying in three-four floor houses in the mostly
plain terrains of Vietnam, it felt quite thrilling to find oneself observing a
birdâ€™s view of charming coastal surroundings both distant â€“ with the
endless palm-tree domed esplanade of Tran Phu â€“ and nearby seafront side
street full of local colour. As if to strengthen a flying bird feeling in me,
there was a picture of a phoenix with its wings spread wide, the symbol of
prosperity and sincere hospitality in Vietnamese culture, chosen as the
MÆ°á»ng Thanh Hotel information booklet logo. The roomâ€™s interior,
featuring elegant light walnut furnishing, three beds and separate sitting
area with the glass wall of the panoramic window as the background, were no
less inspiring and boasted lots of space and natural light to enjoy.  
MÆ°á»ng Thanh Hotel chain recently added Nha Trang to its impressive
collection, now comprising 19 in operation; from Sapa, Dien Bien Phu and
Halong in the north to Vung Tau in the south, all of them being under
Vietnamese management. The MÆ°á»ng Thanh brand started from one hotel in
Northern Vietnam 17 years ago and gradually expanded into all of the major
tourism destinations in the country. A focus on Vietnamese culture and
authentic local traditions, together with an aspiration to bring guests as
close to the real spirit and inimitable atmosphere of Vietnam as possible, are
the main elements that make up the MÆ°á»ng Thanh Hotel chain signature style
of hospitality and all of them are built to provide excellent accommodation
for a modern comfort travel experience.  
The hotel premises are truly expansive, with exquisite four-star
accommodations, featuring 255 rooms, ranging from elegant Deluxe overlooking
either the vast spaces of the sea or picturesque green hill to sumptuous Club
and Presidential suites with an almost 360-degree sea panorama. To ensure the
utter comfort and to provide memorable pleasures for guestsâ€™ pastime, at the
hotel are two restaurants with outstanding local seafood fare and truly
Vietnamese cuisine, cosy bar, spa centre with expansive spa-menu and private
beach with sun loungers.  
The on-spot blue lake of the outdoor swimming pool with an area up to 100 m²
on the 4th floor of the hotel is tailored to serve the prime sea vistasâ€™
observatory with the fresh and salty sea breeze blowing tirelessly. The sea
sensation doesnâ€™t leave one for a second; wherever you are in the hotel, the
sparkling waters of Nha Trang bay are at oneâ€™s full view.  
MÆ°á»ng Thanh Nha Trang Hotel has everything the most discerning traveller
may need for excellent seaside retreat, starting from surrounding vast green
spaces and colourful hilly terrain and direct access to the sea with private
beach that few hotels in Nha Trang can offer, and major sightseeing sites
being within minutesâ€™ drive to the small details and pleasant in-house
surprises that make oneâ€™s stay truly memorable.

Thi Vai Mountain. _Photo: Le Thang My  
_  
Standing at the base of the great green slab of forest-covered rock dropped by
the hand of the Almighty on a featureless plain and craning my neck to see the
lofty summit at 461 metres above sea level, I wondered if I was going to make
it to the top. I began to ask myself why people climb mountains. Maloryâ€™s
famous, honest and straight-forward quote about Everest sprang to mind –
â€˜Because it is there.â€™ But I had more motivation than that. Not having
climbed one for a few years and now approaching the age of fifty-nine, I
wanted to see if my body was still capable of making an ascent. I have climbed
to a few peaks before; most notably South East Asiaâ€™s highest-Mount Kinabalu
in Sabah and Sri Lankaâ€™s Adamâ€™s Peak. On that December morning,
Vietnamâ€™s Thi Vai Mountain had me cowering and doubt was troubling my mind.  
There were other reasons for me or anyone else to climb this particular
mountain. Firstly, this is a Buddhist mountain and there are beautiful and
inspiring pagodas to visit. There is an abundant supply of fresh air not so
readily available to most of us who live in cities. The twittering of birds
and squirrels leaping from branch to branch and the occasional skink scurrying
away as I approached it gave me that longed-for â€˜back-to-nature feelingâ€™.
You may be luckier than me and glimpse a deer or meet some of the resident
monkeys. If you do conquer Thi Vai, you will have a great feeling of both
physical and spiritual accomplishment. Lastly, we all need exercise and
despite all the wheezing and stiffness of muscles, you are likely to feel a
fitter person when you come away from here.  
As above, so below, and even in the middle, there are pagodas. After nodding
to a laid-back monk, I took some photos of the beautiful wooden roofed Lien
Tri Pagoda at the base. On the wall by the first step were a few bamboo staves
for loan. However, I was to rely on my long umbrella for leverage. It served
the purpose well. The other essential for this thirsty business is water.
Bring your own supply, though there is a potable water tank with plastic cup
at the central pagoda. There is only a simple vegetarian restaurant at the
base, so you will probably want to bring along food, too. There are 1,340
stone steps to climb. The good news is that they are wide, in very good
condition and there is even a concrete railing painted to look like logs at
least as far as the central pagoda. After that, the way is less frequented,
rougher and in patches with no steps hewn out at all. The bad news is that
this staircase is very steep. Mostly, the gradient is as much as fifty per
cent!  
Off I set. My initial target was a hundred steps at a time and then a break. I
did this a couple of times, but I was so out of puff that I reduced the number
to fifty and then to twenty-five. Panting and wheezing a lot after half an
hour, I came to a small pagoda housing a golden Buddha with a belvedere, at
which I paused for my first long rest. The day was a bit hazy but there was a
great view of green fields, the industrial town of Phu My, and its port and
across the river to the rural territory of H.C.M.C. There was a house opposite
the pagoda with three generations of a family out taking the air in the
courtyard. The children were curious to see a foreign face and being a
teacher, I found it easy to organise some games with them. By now my small
backpack had become a burden and the family kindly allowed to leave it there.
I drank one of my bottles of water, figuring that this would be enough to get
me to the top and back down again to this level and I was off on my way.  
I passed a white Buddha perched on a rock bearing that symbol of peace most
vilely misappropriated by the Nazis, the swastika. By now I was down to
stopping every fifteen steps to catch my breath and beginning to feel quite
stiff. Then, quite close together, I came across two tracks to opposite sides
of the pathway. There were clear indications that they led to caves. Now, this
mountain has its darker side. There is a harrowing account on the Internet of
fighting on it when a base of The Peopleâ€™s Liberation Armed Forces
established itself in caves on this mountain, only to be evicted by Australian
troops in 1966. After an hourâ€™s interesting but gruelling climb, I had
reached Phuc Hong or central pagoda. The actual pagoda itself is open a few
hours a day only. I contented myself with a long rest beside a stunningly
beautiful lotus pond, guarded by a statue of a white lion. This would be the
ideal place for a picnic. If you only make it to this, you will have been
amply rewarded for your efforts.

Pilgrims on Thi Vai Mountain

Then I got a little lost. I took a path that led me to a minor pagoda, but
then the path became rudimentary and finally I turned back upon seeing a sign
with a cross on it. Luckily I came across a man of my own age who must have
been a pagoda worker. He led, jumping about like a mountain goat, with me
wheezing behind and he told me the top was still far off-about 500 metresâ€™
distance. Now I really felt like giving up, but somehow I soldiered on. How
could I write this article if I allowed Thi Vai to defeat me? This was what
spurred me on. I was now stopping every five steps! Then a wonderful sight;
the sun shining through a rock that had been cleft down the middle. I named
this spot the â€˜Gate of the Sun.â€™ A little further beyond, I found myself
on a black rock with the path now horizontal, not vertical and with the bright
shining Buddhist Goddess of Mercy statue at the Linh Son Buu Thien Pagoda (the
top pagoda) in full view at about two hundred metres away. Wow, Jack had
finally climbed the beanstalk!  
Thi Vai has a fairy tale of its own. In the late nineteenth century, the
mountainâ€™s sole inhabitant was a hermit nun called Dieu Hanh, who dedicated
her life to the Buddha. She gave refuge in her hut to Nguyen Phuc Anh, a
fugitive from the Tay Son rebellion. A few years later, he was crowned King
Gia Long (1802-1814). He remembered his mountain saviour and conferred open
her title of Linh Son, Holy Mother and rebuilt her hut into a pagoda. It is
from this time that Thi Vai became a place of Buddhist pilgrimage.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/8--Lien-Tri-Tu---Nui-Thi-
Va.jpg)_  
A pagoda on Thi Vai Mountain

I paused at the summit only for a short time. In the near distance, there
loomed an even higher mountain. On a clearer day than this, there are views
taking in the ocean, the swamp of Can Gio and the city of Vung Tau. Lien Son
Buu Thien pagoda is of recent construction and the least attractive of all.
Soon, I was making a careful descent, fully aware that this is the most
dangerous part. I borderlined between being intrepid and being foolhardy. I
knew I should not be doing this alone. In case of a serious fall, I only had
my cell phone to call for help. I made it down to the central pagoda with no
mishap, where I stopped for a cup of water and a final view of the lotus pond.
By now, I was very tired indeed, but there was none of the wheezing of the
ascent. I reached the house and belvedere where I met my first other climber
of the day. He was, I think, another pagoda worker. The people of the house
were having their siesta, but the grandmother was awake to hand me my back
pack. Just before reaching the bottom, I came across three young fellow
climbers, one of whom was a monk. I was here on a Monday. If you come on
weekends, it will be much busier. A word of warning: be sure to be back down
before 5 p.m. They close the gate then! As another reminder of the war, I
noticed a sign warning of mine clearance activities as I was leaving the
hamlet and making my way to the H.C.M.C – Vung Tau express way.

Thi Vai Mountain makes a good day out from the city at only a short distance
away. However, it is mainly visited by local Buddhist folk. I have not found
it any guide book and there is even not much information on the Internet
either. I only learned about from Ong Hai, a devoted Buddhist friend of mine.
There is certainly no one in Pham Ngu Lao touting trips there. Yet it is so
much easier to access than the other sacred Buddhist mountains I have climbed.
They are all far out; Chau Docâ€™s â€˜Sam Mountainâ€™, The Black Lady Mountain
at Tay Ninh and Ta Cu Mountain are around twenty five kilometres south of the
city of Phan Thiet.  
If you do not have your own transport, you can reach Phu My Township very
cheaply and easily from Saigon. It is 65 kilometres to there and a further 40
to Vung Tau. You can other take local buses, or for a few dongs more, the Futa
Bus Lines comfortable express bus from which has regular departures from 205
Pham Ngu Lao Street. From the centre of Phu My town, take the road east a
kilometre or so and then turn down a bumpy country lane for a further three to
get to the Mountain.  
I apologise to my Buddhist friends and indeed family members for mentioning
heaven in the title. I know the aim of Buddhism is Nirvana and not heaven but
spiritually if not physically (my poor aching body!), the mountain gave me
quite a heavenly day out. If I have inspired you to take the stairway I am
sure you will be a better boy scout or girl guide than me and be better
prepared. Having said that I think I have demonstrated that all you really
need to enjoy Thi Vai is a healthy pair of legs.

Cuu Village. _Photo: Lam Phong  
_  
Forty kilometres downstream from Hanoi, one comes to Cuu Village in Van Tu
Hamlet in Phu Xuyen District. Many people call Cuu Village â€˜Western
Village,â€™ because they regard the villageâ€™s architecture as perhaps too
peculiar and outstandingly beautiful in comparison with the familiar manner of
ancient villages in the early summer-harvest lowlands of the North.  
However, to be specific, Cuu Village is actually an Asian village with subtle
decorative features that are at once rudimentary as well as open and lofty.
The village borrows a touch of Western style, so as to elevate the beauty of
an architecture that is infused with Vietnamese characteristics. The
interesting thing is that this impeccable fusion has, for almost a century,
retained its original beauty.  
The wealth and prosperity of Cuu Village, it is told, began during the French
occupation. The people of Cuu Village were renowned for the Western sartorial
trade throughout North Vietnam. Owing to this, the village grew quickly and
the villageâ€™s prosperity manifested in the unique ornamental house designs,
which started in the 1920s and continued through to the 50â€™s. Returning to
the Cuu Village of today, the village gate is stately and is the tallest
ancient architectural structure in Cuu Village. The gateway appears like a
giant book that opens up to greet guests. The village gateâ€™s watchtower,
along with its roof tiles, high curved fringes and embossed mythical lion
statues, despite having chipped away with time, still retains its original
ancient beauty.

Cuu Village.

_  
Continuing along the villageâ€™s winding road, the spacious houses and moss-
covered brick alleys gradually reveal a different storyâ€”a story about the
decorative symbols and lines in the architectureâ€”a story whereby people can
fathom the intents of the owners, who wanted to send messages along with word
of their dreams, prayers for auspicious signs, lucky omens and affluence. On
the gate into a house in Cuu Village is an image of a bat, a symbol that is
supposed to bring blessings that include riches, longevity, health, virtue,
and the full enjoyment of oneâ€™s years. On this gate, the bat bears in its
mouth the character for â€˜Longevity,â€™ which is stylized to look round just
like a tortoise shell (the tortoise is a symbol of longevity).  
The people of Cuu Village built high, stately houses with wide doors, but
worked afar and settled in the major provinces and cities. Thus, the
magnificent architectural structures of the period are now almost entirely
devoid of their owners. However, the enlarged character plaques on the arched
gates accentuate Cuu Villageâ€™s exceedingly unique architecture. Each family
in ancient times had their own distinct way of exhibiting lines of characters,
parallel couplets, and architecture. There are plaques of enlarged Chinese
characters that read anything from, â€˜The sun blankets the trees below; a
wellspring of profit arrives from afar. Building this home, may fortune abide
thereinâ€™, to those that suggest a noble air: â€˜Chivalrous and elegant,
diminish arrogance and haughtinessâ€™â€”such are words that remind the master
of the household to exhibit humility among people.

Cuu Village. _Photos: Lam Phong_

One of Cuu Villageâ€™s most beautiful structures today is the home of the
elder Phu Du, in which the family of Mr. Bui Van Khanh now dwells. The house
was built in 1929 and is one of the oldest houses in Cuu Village. On the
entrance gateway is a finely-sculpted image of a prawn with robust pincers
that appear to cradle the four enlarged characters for: â€˜Enter with filial
piety; leave with fraternal deferenceâ€™. Just past the gate, the homeâ€™s
inner space consists of a mix of Asian and Western architecture. The
jalousies, pillars and gables are all sculpted in relief with subject matters
like flowers and leaves and prunings that are very much Western
characteristics, but on the rooftop is an embossment of the familiar
characters, â€˜Fortune, Wealth, Longevityâ€™ (PhÆ°á»›c, Lá»™c, Thá»), which
are often seen in the cultures of Vietnam and China, along with a line of
Chinese characters: â€˜Three stars shine.â€™ This Western-Vietnamese mix is
never confused, but on the contrary, appears harmonious, luxurious, stately,
and to some degree manifests the noble status of the head of the household in
the Cuu Village at that time.  
Walking through Cuu Village is like losing oneself in a storehouse of ancient
literature through the decorative features of parallel couplets that further
enhance the significance and beauty of each structure in the village. Right
from the village gate, a parallel couplet evinces the open-mindedness,
broadness, and free-spiritedness of the people of Cuu Village: â€˜Outside,
peace is not closed to the rivers and mountains that remain just as in
yesterdays/In days to come, prosperity shall abide supremely dignified as
horse-drawn carriages come and go .â€™ Passing through the village gate,
inside is the parallel couplet, â€˜Left and right, the path to the clouds is
recast broadly/North and south, converging to the great level road.â€™  
Indeed, going through Cuu Village, strangers always get a sense of the
villageâ€™s intimacy and congeniality, as if the stranger and the village had
already met a long time ago. Everyone is willing to invite visitors to come
into the house, drink a cup of tea, and receive a few stories about Cuu
Villageâ€™s time of prosperity in days of old. On the villageâ€™s main road is
the building of the Duc Loi garment brand, a tailor shop that is famous
throughout Hanoi. It has a parallel couplet in Chinese characters that reads,
â€˜Prosperity and fortune come to the door, everything fine and
fragrant/Flourishing, the roads are clear for ten-thousands of miles afar.â€™  
Next to the ancestor worship hall, the house of the head of the household has
an enlarged character plaque for â€˜Chivalry and Eleganceâ€™ and a parallel
couplet right at the entrance gateway that says, â€˜On the road home is
sunlight upon the mandarin in service/In the clear wind, the stars lead an old
friend to arrive.â€™  
Thatâ€™s how it is; every time one passes by each house on the Cuu Village
road, regardless of whether people still live there or the doors are shut
silent and abandoned, there is a feeling of going back through time in the
realm of memory. However, above all, from the lines of characters of every
home at its entrance gateway, a purely East Asian character and the particular
personality of the household head are conveyed so that the people of later
generations may, to their heartâ€™s content, come to understand, appreciate,
and explore.

Van Phong Bay, with its beautiful turquoise and aquamarine water, lies nearly
two hours by car from Nha Trang, and is protected by Hon Gom peninsula and two
islands, which keeps it well away from the flood of visitors that usually
descends on Nha Trang. Until recently, Van Phongâ€™s boats were used almost
exclusively for fishing, and fishermen seldom quit the net to take visitors on
sight-seeing tours.  
Recently, I and some others headed for an island in Van Phong. Piloting our
sight-seeing boat that day was a middle aged man, who clearly had spent much
of his life at sea and his son, who looked more shark than human. Dark and
solid, they both used a very unintelligible dialect as they guided the boat
out of the harbour and zig-zagged between sand bars to our destination. The
beach on the island was full of foreign kids lying on the sun, and a
mesmerizingly beautiful girl sat motionlessly, like Andersenâ€™s mermaid on a
lone rock amid blue waves.  
The island we visited had 11 households, almost completely secluded from the
outside world. Fishing boats drop by there before and after long fishing
trips. A few hundred yards from the island are the fish and shrimp farms of
the locals. Since fish farming came into fashion, the island has lost area
primarily due to the hedges emerging from the water.  
The boat owner showed us his familyâ€™s farm. Just a scoop of water sparkling
under the sun, and one sees fish and shrimp wiggling and jumping. One can buy
them for half the price charged in Nha Trang. I idly jumped into the water; it
was clear and cool. Tiny fish circled around me, among them were some jelly
fishes, half a palm-sized.  
Corals and sea anemones slow-danced under the water. They are not as abundant
here as near Hon Mun in Nha Trang Bay, but are breath-taking nonetheless. Van
Phong Bay is a closed part of the sea, with mangrove and tropical forests and
very diverse fauna.  
Itâ€™s bliss to swim in the sea without a soul around, without the noise of
motors and without a piece of rubbish in the water.  
We sat around dinner arranged on nylon and leaves spread on the golden sand.
The grilled cuttlefish still had ink in their guts. Grilled snails, the shells
burned black, smelled quite sweet. There were fish I never saw anywhere else.
The strangest one was called a bull fish, with broad, thin body and eyes
protruding out.  
There is a well at the centre of the island with a bucket with a long rope
there. After dinner, I followed a few new mates there to bathe myself in a
prehistoric way.

The whale festival. Photo: Dang Khoa

**Maritime traditions surrounding â€˜The protector of the seaâ€™**

Every year, when the full moon of the fourth month on the lunar calendar
rises, villagers of Phuoc The in South-Central Vietnam go to Cau Islet (Cu Lao
Cau) for their most important ceremony of the year: Nghinh Ong (Whale
Procession) Festival. This year, the event falls on 13 May.  
I had a chance to attend the festival two years ago.  
I went to Phuoc The, a fishing village about 100 kilometres to the northeast
of Phan Thiet City, when the village was bustling with preparations for the
festival.  
I jumped on a boat to Cau Islet, which is four nautical miles from the
village. The wind blew gently and the sea was peaceful. â€˜Itâ€™s ideal to
visit Cau Islet from January to July, because the weather is fine and the sea
is calm,â€™ said the helmsman.  
After about an hour, the old boat docked at the islet, which is 1,500 metres
long and a maximum of 700 metres wide. The surface was very flat and covered
with wild low weeds, which made me feel like standing on an enormous green
barge floating on the blue sea.  
â€˜There are no natives here, only one border guardsâ€™ station and two shops
selling souvenirs to visitors,â€™ said the boat owner.

**The midnight festival  
** 5:00 p.m. The drums commencing the festival were struck consecutively,
echoing all around the islet. Thousands of people were packed into an ancient
temple. The shaman, named Tran La, told me: â€˜I donâ€™t know when the temple
was built, but I guess itâ€™s about 100 years old.â€™

â€˜That there is a festival on this island today that is due to the fact that
hundreds of years ago, there was an Ã”ng (whale) that washed ashore on this
islet and died. Since the villagers of Phuoc The believed that whales were
sacred creatures, they prepared a funeral and burial ceremony and built a
temple to worship Ong. Since then, a festival takes place every year,â€™
explained an old man in the organizing committee.  
Following the shamanâ€™s offering incense and prayers, a procession with the
altar of the whale was shouldered by tens of youthful men toward the sea,
accompanied by the incessant hums of the drums and gongs. While the procession
stood solemnly on the sandy beach, the shaman stood facing the sea with his
hands holding steaming incense sticks, and mouthing mantras to call whales
from all over the world to attend the festival.  
Right after the shamanâ€™s last words was the sounds of gongs mixed with the
sounds of the drums and about 20 young men in the costumes of sailors from
olden times, carrying a sword on their shoulders and paddles on their hands
lined up in a shape of a boat, sang and danced a traditional ritual. The dance
expressed the work of fishermen: kayaking, seining with a net, and saving or
picking up the bodies or souls of the people who died in the river or the sea.  
After the dancing and singing, the procession was brought back to the temple,
right at the time when the full moon rose up on the sea, spraying bright red
rays on the water. The people gathered in groups, eating, drinking, singing
and dancing on the beach.  
2:00 a.m. The drumbeats resurfaced. Under the yellow gleams of a light bulb,
the shaman devoutly prayed for Ong to bless the villagers with health,
national security, peace, good weather and many marine fish.

**And more on Cau Islet  
** Earlier that day, in the morning and afternoon, I had explored the islet.
On the northern shore were two crudely built cafÃ©s. I went into one of them
and the owner, an old man named Tu Huu, who had fished throughout the region
since he was 10 and had twenty years of keeping the cafÃ© on Cau Islet, told
me many interesting ancient stories of the sea.  
Ordering lunch from Mr Huu, I ran to the sea to seek corals. I knew from
newspapers that the sea around Hon Cau (another name of Cu Lao Cau, Cau Islet)
was one of many coral reef areas with some of the densest coverage and highest
diversity in Vietnam.  
After swimming about 40 metres offshore, I only saw sporadic corals. Mr Huu
told me: â€˜If you want to see dense coral reefs, you have to wear a decent
diving suit.â€™  
At lunch time, I had a good time enjoying braised giáº¥y fish, sour soup with
giáº¥y fish and shrimp, braised anchovies (cÃ¡ cÆ¡m kho tá»™) and squid
steamed with ginger. All of the seafood was very fresh and cooked simply.

Except for the sandy beach, which is about 700 meters long, the rest of Hon
Cau coast was full of rough rocks. The crags on the south were much more
interesting, with many giant rocks rising over 30 meters above the sea level.
Some had such artistic shapes as to seem skilfully sculptured by hand.  
On the cliffs, sea birds constantly flew up and down, landed and stood,
cavalierly pluming themselves. In the middle of a cliff, I found a very
beautiful small beach, which was as pretty as the place where fairies take
baths in the folktales. The curved sandy beach was about 20 meters long and
surrounded by two cliffs reaching out to the sea. The water was as clear as
crystal.  
_Some fishermen at Phuoc The rent out their fishing boats to visitors who want
to go to Hon Cau Islet. The price depends on the time, one-way or return and
the agreement between both sides, which is about VND2,000,000 to VND3,000,000.  
At present, a number of companies in Ca Na and Phan Thiet city organize tours
to Hon Cau Islet with snorkeling and scuba diving at the price of $100 to $200
/ person.  
Phuoc The Commune is located at Tuy Phong District, Binh Thuan Province,
South-Central Vietnam.

11/20/2019,Nature forte at Mom Da Chim Lazi Beach Resort,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/nature-forte-at-mom-da-chim-lazi-beach-resort/,,By Nathalie Sokolovskaya,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/mom-da-chim.jpg,"_(No.3, Vol.4, Apr-May 2014 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

_Photo: Mom Da Chim â€“ Lazibeach Resort_

I settled in with a prime view of the ultramarine sea 20 metres behind a thin
veil of slim-bodied casuarinaceae trees growing right from blinding white
sands on Mom Da Chim â€“ Lazibeach Resort premises, still remembering my ride
on a local bus through the wilder spaces of Southwestern Phan Thiet. The long
but entertaining trip reminded me more of a journey on a creaky long boat with
salty, thick wind from the high sea on the port side and hot and dry khamsin
from sand dunes on the starboard. The peaceful scenes of coastal village life
– the groups of locals taking a bite under the cool shadows of trees, rural
houses lamed in white with their inhabitants taking siesta in their hammocks
or watching the highway with occasional buses and trucks, hotels and resorts
sparsely scattered here and there along the sandy shoreline with spaces of
blue ocean in the background – were akin to fragments of some old documentary
on how Phan Thiet used to be when it was untouched by the tourism industry.

I hopped off the bus and raced across the sizzling hot road into the saving
shade of the Mom Da Chim â€“ Lazibeach Resort premises. The spacious two-level
lobby of the main building with modern architecture, so surprising to find
within rustic naturescapes, is a gateway to an impressive property with
tropical garden at full bloom stretching out to the sandy beach and serving as
green dome for lines of white bungalows, all built in the inspiring shape of
birds with their wings spread wide and overlooking the sea.  
As the porter guided me through the verdant spaces with two swimming pools to
the sea view bungalow, I caught sight of brightly coloured colibri sailing in
the air, birdsâ€™ nests on exotic treesâ€™ trunks swinging in the sea-breeze
and a crane strolling on the green-grass carpet of the garden.  
The ocean front bungalow suite I finally installed myself in impressed one
with an open-air veranda spacious enough to contain a coffee table with cozy
beach beds and boasted a cozy separate sitting area, high ceilings beautifully
framed with jesting beams and hazelnut-coloured furniture. The prime vista of
peaceful surroundings and the immense body of the sea rolling and toying a few
steps away seduced one to give oneself immediately to all kinds of meditation-
spiritual and otherwise.  
The resortâ€™s Ocean Terrace Restaurant, covered in the shade of beach pines
with indoor and open-air sitting areas, also featured an inspiring design of
several dining decks, with an expansive menu embracing the culinary expanses
of Asia and Europe, starting from local must-try specialties like â€˜lau tha
hot potâ€™, Phan Thiet raw fish salad and all the seafood galore one can
expect from a seaside region.  
Step out of the resort garden made on the sandy beach and the uninterrupted
spaces of the ocean and the shoreline running both sides till the very horizon
are at oneâ€™s full sight. On both sides, as far as the eye can reach, not a
single human silhouette can be seen; only the small fishing fleet of round
basket boats parked on the sand and the rocks standing out of water and
growing from the sand spectacularly at a distance.  
Next morning, I headed to the Ke Ga Lighthouse, first of its kind in the
country, built in 1899 by the French. Itâ€™s perched on a small island with
the stunning sandy headland on its back. The islet with lighthouse just asks
to be painted and to be reached immediately by swimming or by whisking to in
the basket boats parked in plenty on the shore. It is divided from the
mainland with a picturesque bay animated by small sea vessels of all kinds.
Here, the peaceful images of coastal life can be observed at their full
beauty; sun-and-sea-breeze- beaten sailors dragging their cockleshells with a
good take of squid out on the shore. Once on the shore, the catch is sorted
out and bought up in minutes by the owners of small eateries scattered along
the seashore. By travelling further south along the highway, one can enjoy the
spectacular coastal sights full of rustic charm, mixed with colourful dragon
fruit plantations, juicy green rice fields and â€˜snowdriftsâ€™ of salt-licks
stretching till the Ta Ku mountain with a splendid Buddha concrete statue on
its top.  
Located amidst truly spectacular nature surroundings away (but within reach,
if needed) from a broad path well-trodden by tourists, Mom Da Chim â€“
Lazibeach Resort features four-star resort accommodations, from casually
elegant standard rooms with balconies to bungalows and suites, allowing
enjoyment of alluring beauty and sweet solitude of the yet wilder coastal area
in complete comfort.

Where would you choose to place a new hotel in Hue? The prime place would be
alongside the Perfume River, or at least a place with views over it. The area
in or around the citadel might also be desirable. Who would dream of the
wooded area south of the city, on the road to the Nguyen dynasty Emperorsâ€™
mausoleums? Ten years ago, a family cleared land here and established â€˜The
Pilgrimage Village Boutique Resort and Spa.â€™ â€˜They said my father was mad
to plan a hotel at this place, which was remote, derelict land at the timeâ€™,
said Director Le Thi Da Lam. â€˜They all laughed at Christopher Columbusâ€™, I
replied. She nodded with a smile.  
From the outside, on Minh Mang Road, a fifteen-minute drive from Hue centre,
the hotel does announce itself modestly; there is a short, grey wall with a
porchway. â€˜This is in accordance with feng shui (Chinese geomancy), which is
everywhere in Hue,â€™ explained Miss Lam. â€˜Traditionally, there is a small
brick or concrete screen in front of a house, behind which is a much wider
area. You have the effect of discovering a secret worldâ€™, continued my
guide.  
Once over the threshold, I found myself immersed in tropical verdure and the
fragrance of tropical flowers. There before me was a â€˜villageâ€™ shopping
street. Each store showcased an aspect of Vietnamese culture. Actually, only
the textile/clothing and ceramics ones were open. The others were undergoing
renovation.  
Further on, in the form of a village communal house, I found reception. It was
the usual structure, with open-air sides, rounded columns, high beams and
rafters with ceramic tiling roofing. However, the wood used was not the normal
dark tropical hardwood. It was a refreshing light-brown in colour. It was, in
fact, jackfruit wood. Usually, the Vietnamese complete buildings quickly. This
was three years in the making. Be sure to look up at the intricately carved
rafters when you go. This architectural gem has almost cathedral-like
qualities.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/23-Swimming-Pool-\(4\).jpg)_

After being checked in by a smiling clerk, I was led to my room. It was
secluded on a wooded slope overlooking a pond strewn with lotus in flower.
Access was by a private stone stairway. Personal, hidden and cosy, I
christened it, â€˜The Birds Nestâ€™. I had, in fact, been given the
â€˜Honeymoon Bungalowâ€™. Anyhow, it provided every possible amenity for my
comfort. Outside, there was a veranda, where I sat out at dusk supping on a
sundowner and listening to cicadas singing and frogs croaking. The interior
was tastefully decorated with genuine parquet flooring and slate, brick and
bamboo walls. In the corner, the TV was on top of a warm brick fireplace and
the centrepiece was the splendid four-poster bed. As a fine touch, sprigs of
small white flowers were placed on the bed, on cushions and on mats. I had the
choice of showering either indoors or outside in a small high-walled garden.  
Miss Lam led me on a tour of the premises. This is a â€˜resort hotelâ€™ – a
term much abused, I am afraid. I would call it a retreat resort. However, as
it has two swimming pools, two restaurants, five bars and a spa area, they can
justifiably call it a resort. It has ninety-nine accommodation units, so it is
at the large end for a boutique hotel, but the tag is apt, as it offers great
personal attention and is not a chain, but family-run, with operational
standards equal to, or I would say surpassing, many a famous name in the hotel
business.  
Leading to the spa area is a path bisecting two pools and flanked by large
glazed ceramic jars. There is a large Jacuzzi to froth and loll in and the
usual sauna, steam bath and massage and beauty treatments. What makes this
special, though, is that there is a large meditation hall, where yoga and the
Japanese and Indian spiritual healing systems of Reiki and Chakra are taught
and practiced.  
I ate a three-course meal at the restaurant near reception. First, true to
region, came the Hue specialty â€˜Banh Khoaiâ€™, a deep fried pancake. This
was scrumptious, as was the main European course-sauteed chicken breast with
green beans and carrot in mushroom sauce. Dessert was poached pear in Dalat
wine with ginger and vanilla ice cream. This was all washed down by beer and
French wine.  
This hotel is a place to refresh both body and mind. It is a teaching and
learning hotel. It also comes with an imperial approbation of a place to come
to and rest.

It is now fifteen years since the Sofitel Saigon Plaza opened its doors and
coincidentally, fifty years since the founding of the now-worldwide luxury
brand of Sofitel. The double anniversary was recently celebrated on 15
February in a style fitting the slogan projected onto a screen in the
hostelryâ€™s large lobby – â€˜French elegance amidst Saigon charmâ€™.  
Invited guests were treated to Franceâ€™s signatory luxury beverage â€“
Champagne â€“ and canapÃ©s exhibiting both French and Vietnamese influences
such as prime beef rolls and cocktail prawns. The opening ceremonies reminded
us of the sobriquet given to the French capital -â€™Paris: City of Lightâ€™,
as employees clad in dark, nocturnal uniforms bearing lit candles in bamboo
cages descended a red carpeted stairway leading from the mezzanine.
Accompanying this was a light show on the ceiling and dulcet piano music
delivered by the renowned Canadian pianist and composer Miss Mary Ancheta.  
After hearing speeches from General Manager M. Bertrand Courtois and local
dignitaries, it was time to enjoy a fashion show from designer Ha Linh Thu of
the fashion label â€˜Pearl Haâ€™ (the Jewellery River). The models were young,
Vietnamese girls, hardly exhibiting a curve, which allowed one to concentrate
on the clothing rather the female form. Someone has genetically modified the
Vietnamese female, I thought, to create these tall, slim creatures. The
clothes were all very tasteful; a mixture of East and West with very little
exposure of flesh. There was nothing outrageous and all of the clothes could
adorn the average woman. Were it not for the priority of my wine merchant
bills, I could even consider one of these outfits for the wife!  
The second part of the soiree was held in the adjoining â€˜Boudoir Loungeâ€™,
for the further degustation of fine French wine and digestion of scrumptious
victuals, which included Peking Duck. A piano was set up for Miss Ancheta and
this time she also displayed her vocal skills with renderings of Jazz
standards.  
All in all, an excellent way to celebrate how lucky we have been these last
fifteen years. Many happy returns of the day to Sofitel Saigon Plaza and may
the marriage of all that is great in France and Vietnam continue to bear fruit
for our lives and for those of generations to come.

Century Riverside Hotel Hue, which occupies the longest stretch of the Perfume
River of any hostelry in Hue, is an imposing and somewhat bland edifice. Yet,
once through the doors, the coldness of the Soviet-era exterior immediately
melts and you are enveloped in the timeless warmth of the friendliest of
Vietnamese cities. â€˜The Centuryâ€™ has a great deal to recommend indeed.  
Firstly, this is a full-service hotel. It has five restaurants, one of which
is a Hue banqueting hall, where guests can enjoy dishes invented for the
Imperial Court whilst being serenaded by musicians playing classical
Vietnamese music. On the terrace, there is a beautiful swimming pool, whilst
further back are the tennis courts. Furthermore, there is a spa-cum- massage
service, as well as a tour desk and travel agent. The hotel has recently
become independent from the Chinese Century chain and adopted the slogan,
â€˜Towards a New Style of Serviceâ€™. My experience of the service was that it
was courteous, attentive and very friendly.  
Another reason to choose this four-star hotel is its superb location. From the
terraces, the entire sweep of the city’s riverside can be enjoyed. To the east
lies a large island. Turning to the west, you can see the Truong Tien Bridge.
Streetside, the hotel is in an quarter bustling with cafes, restaurants,
tailorsâ€™ booths, souvenir shops and general stores.  
You should experience this hotel’s signature cocktail- the ‘Hue Shot’. Sit
yourself down in the gardens by the pool or at a table in the long corridor
terrace and order some snacks and this sundowner. It resembles a
â€˜Screwdriverâ€™, but with rice wine and lime juice added. It really is a
great tangy drink.  
There are one hundred and thirty rooms, eighty of which face the river. The
remainder affords garden and lotus pond views. The corridor has photographs
and paintings of Vietnamese scenes. My spacious white washed Deluxe Riverside
Room was simply but tastefully arranged with dark red tropical hardwood
furniture. There was inclusive tea and coffee-making facilities, as well as
sweet-smelling toiletries in the bathroom. One beautiful touch-the bed was
adorned with purple orchid petals.  
Not only the rooms, but also the dining is very affordable at â€˜The
Centuryâ€™. I ate dinner a la carte on the balcony of the Terrace Restaurant.
I could have made it a three- course meal, but instead I opted for Asian-style
service, having a number of both Vietnamese and Western dishes brought to the
table at once. At least one dish had to be Imperial Hue. I chose the ‘banh
beo’- literally translated as â€˜water fern cakesâ€™, which consist of
shredded shrimp in little milky rice pancakes which are dipped in fish sauce.
Then there was the grilled mackerel in lemongrass. More European were the
succulent slices of chicken breast with honey. Chinese-style squid and roast
pork completed the table.  
To sum up, this is a hotel that offers it all for a wide range of guests. As
for beauty, here nature provides it with one of the world’s most beautiful
waterways, as right under your hotel room quietly flows the Perfume River!

Dalat Edensee Resort, a resort & spa that has quickly become the go-to place
for discerning travellers to savour the charms of Vietnamâ€™s famous
Highlands, has announced a special â€˜Highland Spring Heavenâ€™ package for
guests to escape the heat into the sanctuary of a cooler clime with stunning
views.  
Inspired by the Rhine Valley region in Germany, where Tieu Nhu Phuong, owner
of the resort, has been living, Dalat Edensee Resort is every bit as fabulous
and sophisticated as the area it is modelled after. The decorations, from
guest accommodations to the stately lounge and glamorous rooftop terrace, are
distinctively European, with chandeliers sparkling as if reflected by the
light from Tuyen Lam Lake, beautifully crafted furniture, marble fireplaces
and sweeping staircases, all against a sweeping backdrop of lush pine forest
that takes your breath away the first time you see it.  
This package is priced at VND5,300,000 per room (for two persons), for two
nights, three days accommodation in a Mimosa Superior Room with daily
breakfast, a romantic dinner for two and a full-body massage for two, which
allows you to choose from many tempting options – Swedish, Vietnamese,
Aromatherapy Revival, Thai and Herbal Compress Therapy.  
Also included in the package are welcome drinks and a fruit plate when you
check in, use of the resortâ€™s facilities such as swimming pool, tennis
court, cinema and billiard tables, round-trip airport transfer and shuttle to
and from Dalat city centre.  
Carole, an English lady who lives in Vietnam, wrote this wonderful review on
Trip Advisor after taking her sister and niece who were visiting her from
England, to Dalat Edensee Resort: â€˜I have been lucky enough to stay in some
beautiful hotels around the world, but I donâ€™t think I have ever stayed in a
place that was so spotlessly clean, or where the staff were so professional,
friendly, courteous, attentive, and eager to please. It was obvious how proud
they were to work in such a magnificent setting, and I know from talking to
them that they love their jobs. Iâ€™m not going to describe the resort in
detail, or add photographs, because everything really is exactly how it
appears on the website. What the website doesnâ€™t show, however, is the
professionalism of the staff or the quality of the food and the way it is so
beautifully presented and served. The breakfasts were fantastic with a wide
choice to suit all tastes, including the most delicious breads and pastries
Iâ€™ve ever had in Vietnam. We had dinner in the resort on our second night,
and wished weâ€™d done so on the first instead of eating in the city. The
service and quality was unbelievable, and we felt like royalty. At one point I
said to the waiter â€˜I feel like a VIP!â€™ He replied that all guests at
Dalat Edensee Resort are VIPs. How lovely is that?  
â€˜We are always happy to receive such great reviews,â€™ said Tieu Nhu Phuong,
owner of Dalat Edensee Resort. â€˜But we never rest on our laurels; the team
at Dalat Edensee Resort always strives to make us one of the top resorts not
only in Vietnam, but in South East Asia. The Highland Spring Heaven package is
a way to thank our customers by offering a special deal to escape the heat so
they are inspired to return to us. We also hope that those who have not had a
chance to visit us will do so this time, to experience the ultimate highland
luxury at Dalat Edensee Resort.â€™  
If you want to stay longer as part of the package, any extra night costs only
VND1,990,000 per a couple including dinner. The offer runs from now till 25
April 2014, and includes all taxes and service charges.

_Photos: Mường Thanh Vung Tau Hotel  
_  
Until recently, I had not heard of Mường Thanh. I was flummoxed by the meaning
until I was informed it is actually Thai and could be translated as God’s own
country. A suitable slogan for the company could be God’s Own Hotel. I was
lucky enough to be invited to stay at Mường Thanh Vung Tau Hotel, which has
been opened barely a year.  
That day, I had climbed up and down a mountain and walked several miles of
road in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province. A young female receptionist was there to
greet me with a welcome drink. I was escorted to my eleventh-floor room by the
Front Office Manager himself, Mr Phuong.  
The chairs and wall were white and the furniture dark tropical hardwood. The
colours were reflected in the accessories; white patterned lamp shade and
black wooden clock. There was attention to detail with white leaf-shaped soap
in the bathroom in a black leaf-shaped container. The floors were white tiled
and brown mock parquet. A large widow framed a panorama of the bay, a park and
Big Mountain. To the side, another window afforded a view of much of the rest
of the city. Freshly budding carnations, orange, red and white, adorned the
window- side table and there were fresh tangerines still with green leaves
attached.  
I went down to the second floor for dinner at the Hai Dang Restaurant. I had
been offered both a Western menu and a Vietnamese one. I chose the latter. My
company was Mr Buu, Assistant to the General Manager and Mr Dong, Food and
Beverage Manager. Although this was the table d’ hoteI, I was invited to
select one dish. I went for the San Miguel draught beer at a very reasonable
20,000 dongs a glass.  
The first appetiser was buffalo jerky with raw diced cucumber and garnishing.
The follow-up was a giant oyster baked in cheese and served in its shell.
Next, cubes of pork cut from the ribs, garlic bread and chips. Then, I had
been expecting the frog to hop onto the table dressed in butter sauce, but a
new culinary delight awaited me. The frog meat had been minced, garlic and
herbs added and deep fried into patties. My hosts informed me that this is
quite a common way of serving frog in Vietnam.  
The next course was a visual, as well as a gastronomic, delight-King prawn in
tamarind sauce. I was not so used to eating in courses. The other difference
between home and the restaurant is that we normally begin to eat rice about
halfway through the meal. Here it was served fried with seafood at the end.
That is to fill you up after savouring the other dishes I was told. Quite
right too! I had enjoyed a wonderful meal with just enough room to finish off
with fresh tropical fruit.  
I had a long, peaceful sleep and found a good full buffet breakfast in the Hai
Dang the following morning. I continued eating Vietnamese, with a flavoursome
bowl of Pho with the tenderest slices of chicken. Finally, I tucked into some
kim chi.  
Mention should be made of the hotel’s other facilities. There is a well-
stocked bar with live music some nights on the ground floor. In the basement,
there is a spa treatment salon. On the third floor is the fitness centre, a
karaoke room and the swimming pool.  
All too soon, it was time to get home. In a nutshell, this is a great addition
to Vung Tau’s range of hostelries. Whether on business or for pleasure, this
is an excellent place to rest up, enjoy the great food on offer in Vietnam and
in particular, the wonderful seafood of this town, and even to quaff a great
glass of chilled beer. I look forward to returning here and hope to get to
know some of the other seventeen hotels in this chain.

Vietnamese usually go to pagodas at the beginning of Lunar New Year,
especially in the first month, to pray for a lucky, prosperous and peaceful
new year. Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province is a fantastic place for a pilgrimage.  
Soon after last Tet, I and my family had a one-day trip to Dinh CÃ´ (Co
Shrine) and Dinh BÃ Cá»‘ (Ba Co Shrine) in Long Hai, a beach town, 30 km
northeast of Vung Tau City and 124 km southeast of Ho Chi Minh City. Both of
them are old shrines.  
The driver, who had 30 yearsâ€™ experience driving tourists and knew many
tourist sites in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, said that there were a lot of
pagodas and temples in the province.  
Along the National Road 51 that connects Ho Chi Minh City and Vung Tau, I saw
many big pagodas on both sides of the road. There are pagodas which are not
only sacred, but also famous for good vegetarian food, such as â€˜Tu Vien
Phuoc Haiâ€™ in Dong Nai Province, nicknamed â€˜Bun Rieu Pagodaâ€™ or Rice
Vermicelli Soup Pagoda and â€˜Ni Vien Thien Hoaâ€™ in Ba Ria-Vung Tau
Province, nicknamed â€˜Banh Xeo Pagodaâ€™ or Vietnamese Pancake Pagoda.
Tourists stop here to visit the pagodas and then enjoy the free food. The
pagodas are usually crowded with them.

Dinh CÃ´ is on a hill facing Long Hai Beach. Going through a gate at the base
and going up a short flight of stairs, I was standing at an area for visitors
to take a rest on benches. Opposite this area was the sanctum. My eyes caught
a sign on the wall on which the history of the shrine is written. The sign
said that, two centuries ago, there was a 16-year-old virgin named Le Thi Hong
from Central Vietnam. On a sailing trip, her boat met a storm and she was
drowned. Then villagers found her body and buried her on Co Son Hill, which
was about one kilometer east of the shrine. After that, they built a small
simple shrine, made of wood and leaves, at the seaside. Since then, she is
believed to have always protected and helped villagers and fishermen.  
Mr Thai Van Canh, the manager of the shrine, told me that in 1930, the shrine
was moved to this hill and rebuilt. After many repairs, the most recent being
in 2009, the shrine was bigger and quite imposing.  
There were many gods worshipped in the sanctum, however, the 0.7 m statue of
BÃ CÃ´ stood out. She wore a long red brocade dress, a necklace and a hat
decorated with small pearls. There were also many golden plaques given by
pilgrims to thank BÃ CÃ´.  
The shrine was made of cement and paved with bricks on the floor. It was
decorated with dragon, phoenix, turtle and unicorn statues carved on the
pillars, walls and roofs.  
Next to the sanctum was a two-storey area displaying hats, clothes,
accessories and boat models, which were offered by pilgrims to BÃ CÃ´.  
Taking a rest on the bench, I saw two colour paintings carved on the wall. One
was the painting of the CÃ´ shrine before 1930s. Another was one of rituals in
the Dinh CÃ´ Festival, which is held from the 10th to the 12th of the second
lunar month (10 to 12 March, 2014). The festival includes many rituals, a
unicorn and dragon dance and traditional performances. Mr Canh said the
festival attracted thousands of people every year.  
In 2005, Dinh CÃ´ was recognized by the government as a national historical
and cultural relic.  
The shrine overlooks Long Hai Beach, about seven minutes by foot from the
shrine. Breezes wafted in from the sea, and were not strong enough to dispel
the heat of the dry season, but left my hair in disorder. The hill base below
was crowded with visitors and vendors selling drinks, fruits, souvenirs and
seafood. Visitors sat under the big thatched roofs and the colourful umbrellas
at the seaside and enjoyed fresh seafood cooked by vendors. The children were
not afraid of the noon sunshine and eager to go to the sea for bathing.

We rented 12 chairs at VND900,000 and sat on a thatched roof. A vendor asked
me to buy 80 oysters at VND100,000. She agreed as soon as I bargained
VND100,000 for 100. She grilled oysters on the coals and then added some
peanut and onion leaf. They smelled so good and tasted so delicious.  
Dinh BÃ Cá»‘ is on top of a mountain in Tam An Commune, Long Dat Dist., Ba
Ria-Vung Tau Province. I was out of breath after climbing over 200 steps to
the shrine. However, it was worth it when I was at the top. Standing on the
mountain, looking at the clear blue sky, enjoying the cool of the wind,
contemplating countryside landscape and listening to the sound of the shrine
bell, I felt refreshed.  
According to two paintings hanging on the wall, the shrine was over 250 years
old. The poem on the painting said that back then, Chinese businessmen were
sailing by and they met a storm. While the boat was sinking, a goddess
appeared in the sky and showed them the way to the shore. Since then, she had
appeared many times to protect and help people. So villagers built a small
shrine to commemorate her and called her BÃ Cá»‘.  
Most people visit the shrine to consult an oracle (xin xÄƒm) by shaking a
bamboo tube, which contains bamboo slices, until a slice falls out. On each
bamboo slice is a number. Each number corresponds to a poem accompanied with
interpretation, giving answers to questions of the enquirer.  
I met two Australian tourists visiting the shrine. One of them looked at the
triangle five-colour flags hanging at the shrine and told me a story. He had
bought some five colour-flags as a gift for a friend in Hanoi. The friend was
astonished and told him that this kind of flag is used in funerals. Professor
Tran Ngoc Them, a Vietnamese culture researcher, told me that the five-colour
flags have existed since ancient times. According to the article â€˜On the
five colour-flagâ€™ by Pham Thuc, the five colours symbolize the five basic
elements: green (wood), red (fire), yellow (earth), white (metal) and purple
(water). They are hung at historical sites, temples, shrines, pagodas, and
traditional festivals.  
On the way back to Ho Chi Minh City, we stopped at Dinh Mountain.  
According to the Tourism Guidebook of Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, Dinh Mountain,
in Tan Thanh Dist., in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, 100 km from Ho Chi Minh City,
is 500m high. Dinh Mountain is also called â€˜Dalat number twoâ€™, because in
the evening it is covered with translucent mist and cold air. Among the
streams flowing from the top of Dinh Mountain, Fairy Stream (Suoi Tien), is
among the most beautiful. This stream has small murmuring waterfalls and calm,
clear-blue lakes. According to the General Museum of Ba Ria Vung Tau, Dinh
Mountain has more than 100 pagodas. Some of them were built 300 years ago. One
of the pagodas that attracts many Buddhists to its rituals is To Dinh Linh Son
Co Tu Pagoda. The pagoda has dozens of valuable statues with unique sculptural
values.  
The road to the top was smooth, steep and extremely winding. However, it had a
great view of city below. We stopped at a gate of Ngoc Hoa Pagoda before going
on to the stream.  
The road leading down the pagoda was extremely steep. The pagoda itself was in
a valley covered with big, lush trees. Next to the pagoda was a stream bed,
but it had no water, only large, exposed rocks. A nun told me the stream was
full of water in June in rainy season. She said the stream would make a loud
noise all day and people could not hear one another clearly.

**Precious winter flames in Sapa:** a flash of heat near the entrance to the
market,  
candles in the meat section during a blackout and a fire to get close to in a
restaurant

To know how extraordinarily powerful a thing fire is you only need to observe
that you can light a fire in Sapa in winter, that if you put too long a piece
of wood on the fire it is conceivable that, after you are asleep, the nearer
end of this piece will come out of the fireplace and set fire to the hotel and
that you need to keep the curtains away from the fireplace, and do the same
with the ethnic-minority, back-borne basket in which the wood is delivered to
the room.  
The buildings in Sapa could in general be described as multi-storey concrete
tropical. It is as if the lowland, rice-growing Vietnamese have used their box
architecture for the highlands as well. To wake to the news that such-and-such
a hotel had burnt down would be improbable. But then the existence of the
flint-lock rifle in history shows that you can get fire out of stone. In
passing, letâ€™s mention the imagined slight smell of fired flint you may get
in a minibus on the hour-long drive to Sapa from Lao Cai. This is due to the
pieces of rock that have fallen on the road from the mountains. It may seem
that your very vehicle could be hit, but this, while it has happened, is a
statistically negligible risk just the right size for the adventure of Sapa in
winter.  
At any hour of the day you will see the importance of fire to Sapa in the
ethnic-minority people who carry more than their bodyâ€™s weight of wood
upright in their basket. It had snowed at Sapa a week before we were there –
our stay was Christmas 2013 to New Year – and when we wondered to a ranger at
the stooks of firewood behind a Sapa peak, the wood was, likely story, like a
windfall of apples, a snowfall of broken branches. Wood is so scarce that even
at zero degrees centigrade outside and much the same inside, a cafe, bar or
restaurant is not necessarily going to light a fire in the hearth. The hearth
looks at you without heart, saying, depending our your mood, you are not worth
a fire, that what you wear outside will be needed inside as well, that is, top
to bottom, a beanie or balaclava or both, two or three scarves, a singlet,
shirt, two jumpers and an overcoat, long johns, trousers, two pairs of socks
and a pair of boots with thick soles. If you are lucky you have brought a
woollen singlet from Australia or, as a man from Belgium put it, pulling up
his trouser leg, â€˜merinoâ€™ long johns. Even ye olde hot chestnuts,
reminiscent of Charles Dickens and the Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London
Town, I saw heated not on a brazier but in an electric grill.  
Before we went to Sapa in winter, this extreme sport, not like simply going to
Sapa, but like climbing the local mountaineering challenge Fansipan in summer,
numerous Vietnamese friends and relations told us not to go. Because they did
not know of, let alone know the word for, central heating, the only reason
they gave was that the temperature would hang around zero centigrade in mist
that lasted till 4.30 p.m. Because they did not give a cogent reason, I just
thought, â€˜Oh, theyâ€™re lowland, wet-paddy people who think snow comes out
of a pressure pack.â€™ The most eloquent of these Vietnamese said we were
being . . here they gave a Vietnamese phrase my Vietnamese wife tried to
explain: â€˜It is like thrashing your own body.â€™ I dare say the precise
translation was â€˜masochismâ€™. Of course, to enjoy the biathlon that is Sapa
in winter you need to take it as a bath of beating with Scandinavian birch
twigs, imagine these are in plentiful supply and imagine they are more the
weight of snow-laden branches.  
Some people have a natural handicap for this biathlon, which is a test not of
cross-country skiing and rifle but of the two states sleeping and waking. The
usual way to get to Lao Cai is by sleeper train from Hanoi. I had previously
been led to a hospital in Hanoi after spending 30 or more hours on a train
from Saigon. I returned to Saigon by plane, which is not allowed in this kind
of contest. Whether a compartment on a Vietnamese train is far too hot or far
too cold depends on the compartment, the date, time of departure, the
destination and the personality and emotional state of the traveller. The best
advice is to take a roll of unusually tenacious adhesive tape and hang a
regulation rectangular Vietnamese rain cape between yourself and the air-
conditioning vent. This in addition to the basic balaclava with beanie over
that. They supplied an eiderdown in which it was not likely the down was from
the eider, a northern sea duck, but was most satisfactory as far as it
reached.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_1418.jpg)_  
A load of firewood  
on a crest

This time I was euphoric and careless, on the lap from Hanoi to Lao Cai. When
shortly challenged to descend and reascend a valley via an ethnic-minority
village I became more or less lodged in the seat of the valley and had to
claim â€˜altitude sicknessâ€™. Some people say the altitude is only 1,500
metres, however. As I pretended not to be affected, in coming up the
valleyâ€™s side, I received a telephone call from a slight, mountaineering
companion looking down and telling me I had taken the wrong turn. Trying every
theory, including age, I eventually diagnosed a chill caught on the train,
which had allowed the entry of a nasty bacterium to the walls of my intestine.
My wife obtained some ciprofloxacin under a Canadian brand. â€˜It is made in
Canada,â€™ she said with delight. On closer examination of the box it was made
in Vietnam. By this time it was nearly on to the minibus for return to Lao
Cai. But we had not missed anything of the Olympian enterprise Sapa in winter.
And to show you how good it is a middle-aged Russian woman in our loose group
of four decided she would settle there not like the infrequent snow but for
the rest of her life.  
When we first arrived and got out of the minibus and stood among other hotel
guests in a lobby whose uninsulated walls sucked calories so strongly that
they had no need to stub their cigarettes in a dish of wistfully regarded
beach sand, they looked at us in shock. Many of them we didnâ€™t see again.
The friend who had been there seven times before and challenged us to Sapa in
winter normally was a balanced chatter on the Internet and it seemed
inexplicable when she kept saying, with capitals, that we needed to book a
room with a â€˜FIREPLACEâ€™. Her message was so powerful that when I phoned
the hotel I said, â€˜I would like to book a double fireplace.â€™ The mouth of
the fireplace we got was not much more than half-a-metre wide. I come from the
Snowy Mountains (it is a big country) of Australia and a house where there was
no such thing as a fireplace smiling under a metre-and-a-half and there was
one of these in each of every inhabited room. The wood pile, as high as the
roof and as wide as high, was created by a mighty disc saw like a reflective
lake driven by a belt from a tractor. That in Sapa we got by on only two or
three baskets of wood a day (a few dollars extra for more than one a day) was
due to our intelligent use of the electric blanket. I asked my Russian host
whether we could buy a battery to run the blanket and wear it over our
shoulders as we found our way through the fog.  
There are blackouts in Sapa, as anywhere, and candles were lit in the market
and where wild pork was advertised by a strip of white lard with black hairs
streaming out of it, seeming to stand somewhat on end. What if there is both a
blackout and no basket of wood? A blackout did happen, and, asking at
reception for an extra basket, we held our breaths. My wife complained about
this stopping of steam from my mouth on her cheek. There would be the extra
basket, however. If there had not been, then I did hear there were commercial
baths in Sapa, which would be, I think, of the Turkish, not Scandinavian,
persuasion.  
Not forgetting this is a sport, I had to learn to work out where toilets were
and employ the words politely to wangle use of them. I saw a cafe at the top
of a ladder going up an earth bank. â€˜Can I use your toilet,â€™ I asked.
â€˜There is no toilet,â€™ a young woman said. â€˜I will pay you one hundred
thousand dongs to use your toilet,â€™ I said. She showed me the toilet. I used
it. I dropped ten thousand dongs through the window of her scullery and
descended the ladder. â€˜That is not a hundred thousand,â€™ she said.â€™
â€˜Ten thousand is plenty,â€™ I said. In biathlon terms, I had not failed to
take a corner and soiled my trousers on colourful heather, which would have
required a return to the hotel.  
It is only when you arrive deeply in northern Vietnam that you appreciate
their enlightening form of truth. Language for them is about what you can
achieve with it, not about language with a life and meaning of its own. It is
not the dragon that the speaker is. In fact, conversations are one of two
groups of artefacts that charm most in Sapa, the other being ethnic-minority
handcrafts. About a bowl of noodle soup, I said, â€˜This does not appear to be
thinly-sliced beef.â€™ â€˜No. It is pork but it is very good.â€™ About a
snack: â€˜This was not warm goat cheese. It was blue cheese, probably from
Auvergne.â€™ â€˜The chef is French.â€™ â€˜May I speak to the chef?â€™ â€˜The
chef is not here.â€™ He was also not noticeably French, when he phoned me, as
they had kindly asked him to do.  
There is also, of course, the Sapa indicated in the empathetic statement of a
member of our hotelâ€™s staff: â€˜Sapa is only good in summer.â€™  
It is your aim in Sapa in winter, however, to land at the fireside of any
attractive venue without shooting a wood porter instead of a buffalo-
silhouette target on a crest or drowning in their famous â€˜silverâ€™
waterfall. In fact, the owner of our own hotel was the one in front of the
fire at the establishment of the menu written in French (possibly before the
Battle of Dien Bien Phu, in 1954) when we got there. We were runners up at
this hearth but by the use of patience we moved into first position when our
hotelier left. He also frequented a hot spring, or heated pool, at the EFM
(establishment with French menu). If you cannot find a moose head on a wall in
Sapa you are guaranteed to find a buffaloâ€™s for sale in the street.  
The lowland Vietnamese in the northern highlands sell things, and these things
are more and more made in China, which is not far to the north. On silk, they
say, â€˜Oh, Vietnam has many kinds of silk, and the kind from silkworms is
only one of them, which we donâ€™t have.â€™ On wool, they say, â€˜You are
talking about the kind of wool that comes from sheep. That would be far too
expensive.â€™ This, despite that Vietnam has plenty of woolly sheep at Phan
Rang. It is not as if the extra dollars would go astray. I tried on some of
their so-called â€˜woollenâ€™ balaclavas and pom-pom hats and beanies. I
almost got an adjunct chill from the repeated applications of cold compresses
that these tryings on constituted. I found that darker colours sucked calories
more than lighter. I decided to stick with a white hat my wife had packed and
never put it on without sleeping on it first or warming it by the fireplace.
My hat had a flower appliquÃ©d to it, so that I heard women half my age in a
Lao Cai cafe agree between them I looked â€˜cuteâ€™. This is part of what you
get on the Sapa biathlon.

**Winter promises in Sapa** : a sign of heat in an eatery and not only wood
but a chicken to cook with it

The ethnic-minority people make as well as sell things. I obtained a collage
of Black Hâ€™mong collar embroideries for a wall hanging or table mat. These
embroideries will never be made again once the old stitchers die out. I
obtained a hemp scarf not yet dyed, so that my neck would not take the green
or blue of indigo seen on ethnic-minority fingers. The hemp is spun by hand
the length of a womanâ€™s day as she goes round doing other things. While the
ethnic-minority people survive in clothes made from mountain plants, we
outsiders probably need ones made from animals or least derived from Vung Tau
petroleum.  
Should you not be from Vladivostok, of a certain age and caught this side of
the Urals with nothing to lose, not have evolved the ability of a reverse
fire-walker and go barefoot below zero (as many ethnic-minority people do), or
not know how to live in a wooden-slab hut picturesque in peak and mist, then
Sapa in winter is a surefire (fingers as well as kindling sticks crossed about
the â€˜-fireâ€™) adventure. I cite a young Latvian woman in our train
compartment, travelling on her own, who was going to home-stay in an ethnic-
minority village. The adventure holiday is equal in attraction to the
mollycoddling one in temperate lounges with well-meaning buffets. It has the
lasting frisson of survival.  
The adventure Sapa in winter is realised most essentially when, though despite
the relatively high temperature of zero centigrade, your fire seems, when you
first crouch before it, like one of those used to create â€˜cosinessâ€™ at Ho
Chi Minh City barbecues, comprising plastic logs, an electric light, pinkish-
red, genuine, silk-worm silk tongues and a fan underneath to make the them
lick ravenously. After five or ten minutes, given your degree of faith and the
exceptionally combustible firewood supplied, radiation begins.  
Part of what makes for the adventure Sapa in winter is turning up not fully
prepared. This adventure is not about necessarily bringing icepicks and
crampons on the train but bargaining for surprisingly, dubiously, labelled
Gore-Tex and North Face items, and long johns, in the Sapa shops. The thing to
avoid at all costs is sitting or lying in one place and just relying on
clothes, no matter how many you have stuffed into a 20-kilogram case. A
successful contender at the biathlon of Sapa in winter is one who does not end
up like either one of the less hardy buffaloes that died in the recent snow or
the man who slides like a coffin-shaped ice block from the dogsled that
crashes in the classic Alaska film White Fang. Take it as a caution if this
film is shown on the TV beside the fire in your room, as it was in ours.

Ta Vong Village from a hill.

Ta Vong Village, Trong Hoa Commune, Minh Hoa District, Quang Binh Province,
Central Vietnam, lies along the border between Vietnam and Laos. Viewed from
the top of a nearby pass, the dozens of houses on stilts look like blurred
music notes dancing on the slashing lines drawn by rain drops, amongst the
rocking and rolling mountains and forests.  
Ta Vong Village used to be about two kilometres from its current location,
deeper in the mountains on the other side of the Ta Leng Spring. But it was
dangerous there during the rainy season, because of the steep slopes. In 2010,
a whole mountainside slid down to the spring. Seeing the potential danger, the
local government persuaded the villagers to move to the current location, on a
hill. The new, strong houses, built with support from PetroVietnam, were
constructed at the beginning of 2012.  
In the plans for sustainable livelihood for the population in the buffer zone
of the Project of Nature Conservation and Sustainable Resources Management of
the Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park, Ta Vong was chosen to develop community
tourism. Three households in the village will be selected to host tourists.  
I joined a group of representatives from travel companies and local officials
in a trip to Ta Vong to explore its tourism potential. Smiling warmly and
shaking our hands under the first rain of the season, village elder Ho Khien
couldn’t hide his emotions. So glad you come even in the rain. I thought the
big water had dampened your will. I would be so sad then. He signalled for the
village young men to carry our luggage to his house. Meanwhile, Ho Thi Pang,
Ho Khien’s wife, quickly pounded a handful of fresh green tea leaves, put them
in a pot and boiled them for his guests. Ho Khien explained, The tea tastes
and smells better if pounded like this. Indeed, the sweetness and the peculiar
aroma of the thick, hot tea made me feel warm and comfortable, despite the
rain.  
My first impression was that the village was very clean; perhaps partly due to
the custom of living high in the mountains, where the spring begins. The
people were warm and smiling. The kids were timid, hiding behind doors,
curiously studying us.  
Ta Vong Village has 25 households, with 136 persons, mostly Chut ethnics.
Among our hosts was also Ho Xep, the eldest of the village, an 87-year-old
man, but still strong and sound. Ho Khien was his eldest son.  
Walking us around the village, Ho Khien said, â€˜Right now, water is conducted
from the source to a common container shared by the whole village. The
commune’s primary school is right down the hill, and Ta Vong also has a
kindergarten. Ta Vong has no electricity yet. For the guests that night, Ho
Khien had a tiny, dim bulb connected to a few batteries in a bamboo tube.  
Lunch, prepared by Ho Thi Pang, consisted of forest banana flower, spring
fish, boiled forest vegetables and rice. All was served on a very beautiful
rattan tray. Mr Dinh Tien Dung, Trong Hoa commune’s cultural officer said, The
local government is persuading the villagers to stop slashing the forest and
farm only on land that was already cleared. Up here, they can only plant low-
yield rice, alternating with cassava, corn and sweet potato. The government
subsidizes the villagers with 15kg of rice per person per month during the
first five years of farming, to stabilize their lives.  
We ate and talked, our spirits fermented by rice wine. From time to time, old
Ho Xep pensively and with much melancholy pointed at a high mountaintop on the
other side of the spring : “Our village used to be there. Moving around was
hard because the slopes are so steep. We lived in fear every time it rained.
The house could be swept down at any moment. The kids had to skip school. Now
we are happy. If the project people teach us how to develop tourism to earn
our living, then we have no more worries.”

In the afternoon, we took a walk around the village and the neighbouring Do
Village to ask about the festivities and customs of this people. The Chut
people in Ta Vong still keep some of their traditional festivals. The rain had
stopped. The clouds slid slowly between the dwellings, making the whole scene
drift and bob somewhat. Darkness fell quickly, pulling with it the dim light
of the month-end moon, just enough to make us feel the vastness of space. Cool
breezes passed through our hair, swaying the light of the candles that we
brought. Our conversation also swayed till after midnight, while the whole of
Ta Vong was deep asleep in the lullaby of the mountains and the song of
nocturnal birds.  
The next morning, I woke up in the sound of _pồi_ pounding. The sound came
from all 25 houses of the village, like a symphony orchestra. P _ồi_ , a
mixture of corn, rice and cassava, is the main dish in the villagers meals.
The women woke up very early to make _pồi_ for their family’s breakfast. Every
kid had a piece of _pồi_ while walking downhill to school.  
After breakfast, we went to contemplate the beautiful views along the Ta Leng
spring. Cascades of small waterfalls, pebble beaches and graceful turns made
the spring look so romantic and attractive. Lining the spring, stripes of
grass and bushes of cornflowers, tormentose myrtles and other wild flowers
that I don’t know the names of woke up under the morning sun, full of life.
Dew drops sparkled on the leaves, and wooden bells rang with every step the
buffalos made. We went uphill, and the village was reduced to neatly arranged
toy houses.

The TV reports and articles advertising VIP journeys to desert islands, tucked
away in the desolate stretches of tropic seas, promising the Robinson Crusoe
experience of a century at fabulous prices, always leave me utterly perplexed.
Vietnam, just like India, Cambodia and any other South-East Asian country has
everything to fascinate a foreigner to the fullest.  
All that one needs is to be willing to take a walk on the edge, which usually
is some steps away from the path red-stamped by guidebooks and widely trodden
by tourists (one will find that this road less-travelled is the edge of a
trampoline!) I leave Nha Trang at the crack of the dawn on a shuttle bus
heading to White Sand Doclet Resort & Spa, 50 km from the city. As we drive
away from downtown and taxi off the provincial highway, the panorama
dramatically changes; the air from the sea gets more salty, colours become
more vibrant and dense, as though a storm of many days has broken, the sky
shadowed by wandering leaden clouds already conquered by the sun.  
The rough sea of a bustling fish market at the height of its trade hour
emerging behind the window looks all ready to steamroll its giant living body,
borrowed from Rabelaisâ€™ Gargantua, over a gaping stranger. Its menacing
image fades to give place to the riotous tropical tree groves that alternate
with juicy green and emerald rice fields with snowy white cranes stepping
gracefully and leisurely or hovering over them with their wings wide spread
and looking like white toy kites, all of them forming an overwhelmingly
peaceful landscape, where the very kind of silence one can hear a minute after
the bell rings in an empty chapel can be seen and is palpable, even from a
distance.

To add some piquancy to the still-life images of the small fishing village
houses with neatly-kept gardens lined up along both sides of the road are some
surprising, funny- looking and totally unconventional road signs showing to
the amazed travelling audience: a) â€˜Gentleman in old-fashioned derby, arm-
in-arm with a noble-looking lady in the middle of the countryside crossingâ€™,
b) â€˜Old man with walking stick in one hand and stoop baboushka in other
crossingâ€™, c) â€˜Old man with small kid crossingâ€™, d) â€˜Nodding trees
here and thereâ€™, etc. It is obvious that here, road sign painters made
maximum use of the absence of obligatory written records for road signs and
realized all their creative urges on the most prosaic material one can
imagine. On its way, the bus passes picturesque and glistering bright blue
lagoons with giant hammocks of fishing nets slung above them, looking
extremely exotic and bursting with the rustic charm of an old Asian fishing
village, where the way and pace of life has barely changed for the last 100
years.  
Finally, the bus wheels out on a small village road, which ends at the huge
gates of the four-star White Sand Doclet Resort & Spa, which impresses one
with vast spaces of the property yet from the threshold. On the right, from
the reception lobby framing the lightly hilly terrain with an ancient house
temple on the top are mango trees lined up along an alley leading to the wide
stretch of sandy beach. A spacious and light reception lobby with rattan
furniture greets arriving guests with a big Xmas tree in its gayest dress in
the beginning of November, which is really touching and creates a festive mood
right from the first steps made within the resort. In a few minutes, Iâ€™m
guided through the White Sand Doclet Resort & Spa property by smiling and
hospitable Ms Tania, the CR Manager. The huge and flamboyant tropical garden
carpets out on both sides for an impressive 22 hectares bordering the sea and
is divided into resort and recreational areas for guests coming on a one-day
tour. The exotic resort garden casts a cool shadow on the four lines of cozy-
looking bungalows and two deluxe-room buildings and runs down a white sandy
beach, where the deep green grove of slim-bodied beach pines frame it
beautifully. White Sand Doclet Resort & Spa features five types of
accommodations to fit all tastes, from Executive Ocean Front and Ocean View
Villas to elegant Deluxe and Superior rooms, with spacious private balconies
overlooking the swimming pool and tropical garden in blossom.  
The White Hill Restaurant, in the same building where the reception lobby is,
impresses with a cozy interior with bamboo-and-wood furniture in warm, sunny-
coloured shades and with a rich choice of buffet breakfasts, comprising both
Asian and European dishes.  
With a step on a sandy beach, one observes the sweeping, sandy shoreline
stretching for a few kilometres both sides. It is Doc Let beach, one of the
most beautiful sandy beaches surrounding Nha Trang, which still remains hidden
from the mass of tourists. On this first sunny morning after the storm, the
shoreline was gleaming and rinsed with surf and all spotted with fanciful
shells polished by seawater and all ready to turn into an exclusive necklace
for all interested beach walkers. In the distance, a fisherman has just pulled
the net out of the water and has frozen for a moment, peering into its depths.
A few miles away from shore, there is a little island, which is also a part of
White Sand Doclet Resort & Spa and can be reached on a yacht and used as a
romantic or adventure destination.  
White Champa Spa, tucked in the deep of the garden, boasts a truly impressive
design full of local colour and both a mysterious and relaxing atmosphere. Its
interior design, with exclusive antique furniture of fanciful shapes, stone
sculptures and wooden screens with silhouettes of ancient Champa dancers on
them are charming decorations for spa packages to treat your precious self.
The outdoor verandah for massage, with the ocean waves as a background also
offers an amazing chance to walk through all stages of life in five seconds
and be reborn. Ask the skilled spa therapists how and watch your step!  
Primarily located on the stunning white sand beach in the colourful
surroundings bursting with the local rustic charm of a fishing village, away
(but within a reach, if desired) from the touristy area, White Sand Doclet
Resort & Spa has everything the savvy traveller may need for an excellent
seaside retreat, starting from vast green spaces and direct access to the sea,
to the small details and pleasant personal discoveries that make oneâ€™s stay
truly memorable.

11/20/2019,A peak experience at Muong Thanh Sapa Hotel,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/a-peak-experience-at-muong-thanh-sapa-hotel/,,By Nathalie Sokolovskaya,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_2479.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/TRE_6722.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/TRE_6739.jpg,"_(No.1, Vol.4, Jan-Feb 2014 Vietnam Heritage Magazine,Advertorial)

The northern region of Vietnam, bordering China, is an amazing mountainous
land with natural beauty almost untouched, grand vistas, immense, glistering
mirrors of rice paddies filled with water and wind made of pinewood smoke, a
mix of herbs, indigo and juicy forest leaves. The land of dense fog turns each
close corner of snaky mountain road into the edge or the end of the universe.
This mysterious land is inhabited mainly by Hmong and Red Dao hill tribes,
known as tireless walkers, mighty sorcerers and most hospitable people.  
An amazing adventure of travel to the northern highlands to the small high-
hill station of Sapa, founded by the French in the beginning of the last
century, starts right from the Hanoi railway station. One can choose from a
rich variety of trains, ranging from the luxurious Victoria Express, fine
Livitrans and Tulico, to the most unpretentious car one can imagine, with
small plastic stools instead of traditional seats, for some $4, reserved for
the most fearless and reckless travellers in search of an unforgettable
experience.

_

The train arrives to its final station, Lao Cai, at 5 a.m. and spits out the
flow of passengers, a good half of which are immediately seized by mini-bus
drivers. The bus departs almost immediately. In ten minutes, it starts the
climb up to Sapa along a serpentine road. The morning mountainous air dashes
through open windows like luxuriously served breakfast. Sapa, our final
destination, placed its auberge at the feet of Fansipan, a splendid peak of
the Hoang Lien Son mountain chain.  
Fansipan, with its height of 3,143m, is the roof of Indochina and the only
snowy (and then only occasionally) peak in tropical Vietnam. However, each
year of the last three, Sapa has had several snowfalls, with a particularly
heavy one that formed an impressive 10-centimetre layer on 15 December 2013.
This most recent sensation appeared in breaking news of Vietnam and was a
widely discussed topic and a boast, both in northern and southern Vietnam, for
the whole week that followed.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/TRE_6722.jpg)_

_

On my arrival to Sapa to the four-star MÆ°á»ng Thanh Sapa Hotel at New
Yearâ€™s Eve in the early morning, it was so absolutely freezing that it was
hard to believe I actually was not in Siberia. I had the luck to behold the
peaks of mighty Hoang Lien Son mountain chain spotted with snow. The early
morning in this small hill station boasted mountain air so crystal clear and
fresh that one could almost hear it ringing and clinking, the kind of
sensation the famous Masuo Basho might have felt while writing his sparkling
hokku; â€˜The wind from mountain Fuji/ If only I could bring you on my fan
down to Edo/as the most precious gift.â€™  
The Deluxe Room Iâ€™ve been booked in turned out to be rather impressive, with
lots of space, a light palette of modern furnishings and a charming view of
the small lake in the heart of Sapa. But the biggest pleasant surprise was the
electric fireplace, an amazingly realistic imitation of a real one full of
burning and gleaming wood waiting in the corner of the room. It eventually
metamorphosed into a totem creature for me to contemplate after long hours of
trekking and hiking, to bend the knee to and say prayers of sincere gratitude
for sharing warmth during the cold spell of next few days. Its gleaming and
beaming image has highlighted my stay in frosty Sapa just on par with
unforgettable treks to ethnic minority villages and wanderings through
moonlike landscaped rice terraces.  
MÆ°á»ng Thanh Sapa Hotel belongs to a local chain of nearly 30 hotel projects
in Vietnam, 19 of them are in operation, from Sapa, Dien Bien Phu and Halong
in the north to Vung Tau in the south, all of them being under Vietnamese
management. A focus on Vietnamese culture and authentic local traditions,
together with an aspiration to bring guests as close to the real spirit and
inimitable atmosphere of Vietnam as possible, are the main elements that make
up the MÆ°á»ng Thanh hotel chain signature style of hospitality and all of
them are built to provide excellent accommodation for experienceâ€“based cum
modern comfort travel.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/TRE_6739.jpg)_  
_Photo: MÆ°á»ng Thanh Sapa Hotel  
_

As it turned out, MÆ°á»ng Thanh did stand out from many four-star hotels I
stayed in during my long 10 years of residing in Vietnam and had quite a lot
of features to amaze its guests, starting from nontrivial solutions in
interior designs with live trees, spectacular mountain peaks carved in stone
and marble at the lobby and restaurant that creates a vivid illusion of dining
in the spectacular valley at the feet of the mountains which appear to be
growing higher than clouds. The sophisticated ornaments on the walls in its
corridors burst with exotic local colour. The daily buffet breakfast
represents the full bright palette of local culinary specials and northern
Vietnam soul food (which four-star international standard hotels usually
lack), including locally-grown vegetables galore (both cooked and fresh),
sticky mountainous rice, pho, taro and sweet potatoes tempura, cari and
excellent mint tea and coffee to give a great start to a chilly morning in the
mountains. The dominant note of the buffet is Asian food, though, and European
cuisine admirers should take this in to consideration.  
MÆ°á»ng Thanh Sapa Hotel has a very quiet and convenient location a bit aside
from the noisy tourist quarter and features 93 elegant deluxe and three
opulent VIP suites with all modern equipment, spacious bathrooms and panoramic
windows looking out on either Ham Rong Mountain or a peaceful lake in the very
centre of Sapa.  
Sapa itself offers a great range of treks and hiking adventures to remember
and a very special atmosphere, tranquillity and peace one can hardly find
anywhere else in Vietnam.  
Climb up the Fansipan peak, get inspired on its summit, free from all
squabbles and troubles of daily modern life left and forgotten far below; feel
yourself back in the place where you belong – the place where mountain spirits
sing their songs and clouds are being born.

11/20/2019,Sacred mountain offers mediation in luxury,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/sacred-mountain-offers-mediation-in-luxury/,,By Pip de Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge1.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge2.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge3.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge4.jpg,"_(No.1, Vol.4, Jan-Feb 2014 Vietnam Heritage Magazine,Advertorial)  
_  
 _![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge1.jpg)_

What exactly is a mountain? At what altitude does the difference between a
hill and a mountain begin? Nobody would say there are mountains around London.
The highest point, Leith Hill, at 294 metres, is definitely not a mountain.
Yet the sacred limestone outcrop of Nui Sam, a centre of Buddhist pilgrimage
six kilometres to the west of Chau Doc town, at only 241 metres above sea
level, is called a mountain. Rising abruptly from the pancake-flat terrain of
the Mekong Delta, hard fast on the Cambodia-Vietnam border, I believe it is
justly called a mountain. From its summit, which I visited in 2001, there are
spectacular views over Cambodia, and the piece of Vietnamese territory that
juts into that land. At that time, I saw a billboard announcing the impending
opening of The Victoria Nui Sam Hotel. Then, recently, I received an
invitation for the opening of The Victoria Nui Sam Lodge on 19 October 2013.
What on earth was going on?  
I was taken by coach with a party of writers and photographers to Chau Doc.
Some people complain about the remoteness of this area. Others see it as part
of the charm. It does take around six hours to get there from Saigon by road,
but there are rumours a regional airport to be located some fifty kilometres
from town. You may wish to stay in town before or after venturing out to the
mountain and there is a Victoria Chau Doc Hotel right on the riverside. The
place is a pleasant country-a Mekong market town. You can enjoy a trip on the
river to see the houseboats, which inside have an area cut out for fishing
(some families rarely come ashore) and a nearby ferry can take you to see a
Muslim Cham village.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge2.jpg)_

Once we reached the foot of the mountain, we were transferred to minibuses.
The serpentine country road to the lodge is too narrow for wide-bodied
vehicles. The road ends at the lodge. It is a further twenty-five or more
metres along a trail to the summit. You can see a castle-like structure from
the lodge and indeed, this being a border area, there is a military presence.
The soldiers are quite used to hikers and pilgrims and aside from maybe trying
to cadge cigarettes, will not bother you.  
But, if you are reasonably fit, you should walk up the mountain at least once.
There a couple of large, oft-frequented pagodas at the base of the mountain,
in the village. This is a major centre of Buddhist pilgrimage and the
Vietnamese come from far and wide. It is also very favoured by the Chinese and
their architecture is widely evident here. There are marked trails and it will
probably take you half an hour to the top, even counting stops to see the some
of the many small pagodas and pavilions dotting the slopes, which are randomly
strewn with large boulders. There is a particularly interesting Buddha statue
in a cavern. Then, you also may come across plaster statues of rhinos, zebras
and, near the top, one of a dinosaur as well. You might imagine Disney got his
inspiration from here! In addition you may be hailed by vendors out to sell
you bottled water, sunglasses, hats or other perceived needs.  
Our coach arrived just as a colourful lion dance, with all the usual
accompanying cacophony, was in full swing. This tradition, used to invoke good
augur for new enterprises, is, of course, taken lock, stock and barrel from
China. I am always amazed that with all that jumping up and down in costume
and in tandem on tables and chairs nobody does him/herself serious injury. I
got engaged in conversation with a young Frenchman who told me he was the
lodgeâ€™s designer and this was the culmination of ten months hard renovation
work. Hoping that, as a writer, I could shed some light, he asked me, â€˜Do
you know why the building was left to rack and ruin for ten years? Your guess
is as good as mine,â€™ I replied. Later I was offered the explanation, â€˜They
decided they did not need another four-star in Chau Docâ€™, given by someone
official. Now you do not spend a million dollars on a luxury building and then
do your marketing and feasibility studies afterwards. It is an imponderable,
but I would guess someone’s need or greed was not being satisfied. Anyhow the
spankingly bright good-as-new lodge has had a fairy tale ending-or should that
be beginning?

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge3.jpg)_

We were led into the reception area, which with its pastel colours, departs
from the Victoria Hotels tradition of recreating the French colonial area. A
huge Khmer bust (there is another in front of the swimming pool) reminds you
that you are not so far from Angkor Wat. We were seated and shown a remarkable
video. The first scenes were of how decrepit and decaying the buildings had
been left. There were desolate guest rooms with mildewed walls and totally
unserviceable bathrooms. The bridge way to the belvedere and tower was so
dilapidated that it was cordoned off for safety. We next saw scenes of the
renovation and then the newly transformed lodge.  
Now, before having lunch, we received confirmation that there is indeed no
such thing as a free lunch. Madame Pasquale, the General Manageress, announced
we were all to be formed into colour-coded work gangs and asked to plant a
tree. â€˜Furthermore, we have a little ruse,â€™ she announced. â€˜You are all
requested to write your name on a tag and attach it to the tree.â€™ â€˜The
tree is your responsibility and you will have to come back every year to check
on its progressâ€™. Some were given acacias to plant. I got a green bamboo
tree, which I learned was â€˜trucâ€™ in Vietnamese. I had previously only
known this word as a girlâ€™s name.  
On it was to view the rooms. This is a small hotel, a boutique, as they like
to say, with only twenty-six rooms. As you would expect, they are all
luxurious and well-appointed and have the added bonus of each having a terrace
long enough to set up a game of nine pins. The scenery from here is nothing
short of â€˜wowâ€™, creating a great place to finish off reading â€˜War and
Peaceâ€™, do your meditation or sip away on your sun downer. Not only that,
but for but the stargazers among you, come nightfall, you will have your own
personal astronomic observatory. I am told the sunrise is also spectacular
here. Please ensure a pre-dawn wake up call for at least one day of your stay.
We were invited to see it, but being billeted in the Chau Doc Victoria and
what with all the wining and dining, I decided it unwise to burn the candle
both ends-next time!

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Victoria-Nui-Sam-Lodge4.jpg)_  
_Photos: Victoria Nui Sam Lodge  
_  
The rooms of the lodge are bungalow style and arranged terrace-style, so as to
ensure a perfect view for every one. There is a very steep staircase leading
down to the pool. If you have ever climbed the stairs of Angkor Wat, you will
know where they got their inspiration. This, of course, as Mme Pasquale
admitted, makes it a difficult place for the disabled. If you are not so
active, do not hesitate to come here, though, for the views and to enjoy a
meal in the reception cum dining area.  
The spacious swimming pool itself reaches to the edge of the cliffs, so it
appears to be a natural infinity pool. What a great place too cool off, relax
or meditate and perhaps enjoy a cocktail.  
The staff was put to the test by attending to us at the Vietnamese evening
meal. Some of the trainees also performed in the soireeâ€™s performance. A
team of young local karate exponents put on an animated display. There was
Arab dancing with Moroccan-style costumes. Only the fact that men and women
were dancing together was unrealistic. The minority folk were not left out and
we were given a taste of their dancing styles too.  
It may be of interest to know that the peace and calm of Nui Sam is not just
for Buddhists. It is there to renovate your spirit, just as the Bassac River
is there to be enjoyed, not just by the houseboat folk and the charming town
of Chau Doc is there to be experienced, not just by its melange of Vietnamese
Khmer and Cham inhabitants.

The only dirt-and-schist island among 1,969 islands of the World Heritage Site
of Ha Long Bay, Tuan Chau Gem Island, a bright pearl of Vietnam is and will
always be the place that no tourist, foreign or domestic, wants to miss on any
tour to explore Ha Long Bay.  
The island boasts a theatre for sea animal shows with a level of
sophistication that must be seen to be believed. Charming dolphins from South
Australia, and mischievous seals and sea lions from the Gulf of Alaska come
here to be trained by young, beautiful and talented Russian trainers to become
well-trained circus performers in unique breathtaking shows.  
There is a music stage, the most modern in South-East Asia, resembling a
gigantic clam holding, sensational and splendid shows with lively soundtracks,
synchronized with thousands of fountains, coloured lights, lasers, and tens of
fire spitting pillars. It also had the honour of hosting the pageant Miss
Vietnam 2004 and Miss Vietnam – A thousand years of Glamour – 2010.  
There is also a busy modern harbour, crowded with luxurious yachts and
cruisers, attracting many international investors. This tourist centre
connects the World Natural Heritage of Ha Long Bay with the Worldâ€™s
Biosphere Reserve of Cat Ba. It is also the best place to start Ha Long
explorations. In the near future, the Cruiser Harbour of Ha Long Bay, the most
modern and biggest in the region, will be completed at Tuan Chau, to push up
the value of the brand name of Ha Long Bay â€“ Vietnam.

Hidden in the very deep of pine forests, Dalat is an enigma that puts a
lasting spell on everyone paying it a visit. The perfume of mystery is almost
palpable in the Dalat air. It makes those who felt it at their first visit to
come here again and again. The very special atmosphere of the city that, no
doubt, is partly created by high mountain air that makes new-comers tipsy and
overexcited, but is also richly flavoured by intrigues and secrets of the
close past, when French colonial elite was living its passion here.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1-By-Natasha.jpg)_  
Du Parc Dalat Hotel, formerly Novotel Dalat, in Tran Phu St.

_

With old French architecture and a general European-city-like image, Dalatâ€™s
beauty can be compared to the cold beauty of a lightly snobbish aristocratic
dame who keeps her real face under voile. This city impresses by an amazingly
weaved combination of habits left from colonial times; as a fashion of
1940â€™s French with berets, long coats and scarfs prevailing amongst the
elderly generation of the cityâ€™s inhabitants, local wine producing
tradition, freshly baked small croissants in the streets, old songs and tango
from the windows of houses, and multicolored features of authentic Vietnamese
culture.  
Mountains seem to completely conquer the traditional understanding of time.
Dalat visitors get a chance not only to live through four seasons a day in the
local mountainous climate, but also meet face-to-face the mysterious living
past that hasnâ€™t yet left the city.  
Situated high in the mountains, at the altitude of 1,500 m, between the earth
and the heavens, Dalat has a fabulous bouquet of mysterious stories, its own
spirits and ghosts and even small miracles such as self-revolving wooden
tables.  
The city cinema building that used to be a central market in the old times is
piquantly repudiated for its unusual regular visitors-two spirits. Today,
local cinephiles get a chance to watch not only the promised movie but also
some other surrealistic performances: the vague silhouettes of two men in
clothes from the beginning of the last century are said to cross from time to
time a cinema room during a movie projection. These mystical gentlemen move as
if they are choosing some products in the market, walking without any haste
with several stops on their way from one dark corner of the cinema room to
another. None of Dalatâ€™s inhabitants can tell where these unusual personages
appear from and to where they subsequently disappear. They are only said to
love visiting the cinema when old white-black movies are being projected.  
The old French style chalet of the last queenâ€™s father, Nguyen Huu Hao,
towering high above the beginning of Khe Sanh Street, also has a mystical
reputation for its sinister inhabitants, and reminds one of an ominous villa
on the hill from old Hitchcock horror movie.  
Dalat possess a considerable number of old villas, badly repudiated for their
sinister inhabitants. Some of them are so sinister that no one dares to live
in those houses for dozens of years.  
The scariest is Chrysantheme Villa at the very gates of Dalat city, on the
Prenn pass. This old French villa has been a witness to the mysterious death
of a whole French family who lived there, more than 40 years ago. After their
death, the perished house owners started to haunt the house, scaring the
inhabitants of the whole city. Starting from the 1970â€™s, no one has dared to
live there. Even during the most violent winter colds, homeless people never
enter it. Only a couple of years ago some daring businessman from Saigon has
bought it for an uncertain purpose, and he still doesnâ€™t live there. There
is only an old man guarding the old villa and living on a few tips from the
rare tourists who have enough courage to go there. He has installed an altar
to burn perfume sticks for spiritsâ€™ peace. However, he never turns the light
off at night.  
The ghosts are said to be frequent guests at Dalatâ€™s oldest hotels, but
these errant souls seem to be much friendlier than those from the scary villa
and only add a piquant touch to the charm of these hotels.  
If friendly spirits did ever exist, they would definitely choose Hang Nga Moon
Villa on Khuynh Thuc Khang Street for their auberge.  
The Moon Villa, known amongst indigenous people and tourists as Crazy House,
is probably the most insolite and delirant construction in South-Eastern Asia.
This fantastic guest house was erected 10 years ago by lady architect Dr Dang
Viet Nga. Inspired by the natural beauty of the mountainous city, the
architect planned to build a villa that would harmonize with the natural
landscape as much as possible. The result of her vivid imagination, great
inspiration and hard work stands above all possible expectations.  
Moon Villa represents an immense, branchy tree made of concrete, with
labyrinths of honey-bee house like corridors, sheltering 10 rooms.  
Each of villaâ€™s rooms has its own friendly spirit: Bear, Eagle, Tiger, Honey
Bee, etc., placed in the center of each room to guard a sweet sleep of their
guests. The whole incredible construction is finished by giant Beton giraffe
outside.  
One can break the eyes trying to find a single sharp corner in the whole
building! But there is none.  
The author of this fantasy of stone and concrete is Dr Dang Viet Nga, an
outstanding woman who had overcome many obstacles, but managed to conquer her
fantastic world from banality.  
Her Moon Villa is a place where all the notion of time and space can be
completely lost and forgotten for an hour or even night or two and where one
can be swept away by a riptide of its authorâ€™s powerful fantasy!  
Dalat is the city that strikes by mysterious atmosphere, inimitably weaving
the amazing combination of old French architecture with traditional Vietnamese
pagodas and even with Zen Buddhism monasteries, by peaceful neighborhoods of
juicy yellow bamboo valleys and deep green pine forests, by the happy co-
existence of the close past and the present. This city seems to turn contrasts
into amazing harmony, to reunite and to deflect two opposite categories-the
past and the present. It seems to know the secret of time deflection, and it
has got its own time niches and time bridges. It even possesses its own time
machine! It departs daily at 4 p.m. from Dalat old railway station, so anyone
intrigued has a chance to experience how it feels like to travel across times
and cultures at an hour.  
The old steam-engine locomotive that carries tourists throughout time and
culture has its own interesting story to tell. The railway connecting Dalat
with Phan Rang on the central coast was built by French in the early 20th
century. It gave the high hill town development its kick-start and led it to
the pretentious position of the summer capital of colonial Indochina. To make
the train resistant to mountainous landscapes and hard passes, it was supplied
with specially-designed saw teeth-like wheels. In 1997, seven km of rails
leading to Trai Mat village was restored to serve tourists. The route is not
that long, but provides the full variety of bright impressions. A few minutes
after departure and one observes the total change of outer decorations from
the cold beauty of a European look-alike city to truly Asian countryside with
tiny houses, small gardens that seem to have just escaped from some kind fairy
tale, persimmon trees with bright orange fruits, flower greenhouses and Linh
Phuoc Pagoda as a final route destination.  
Built in 1953, this pagoda is one of impressive examples of authentic
Vietnamese architecture. Itâ€™s one of the brightest reflections of the
imagination and skills of Vietnamese artisans at their full creativeness and
inventiveness. The full complex comprises the two-storey pompous main pagoda,
richly decorated with a multicolored mosaic of broken porcelain dishes with a
five-metre Buddha on a lotus flower inside, and a six-level tower covered with
sophisticated ornaments, giving a magnificent panorama of surroundings from
the top. The tower shelters an immense bell fixated to the very top, seen from
the ground floor as the bottomless eye of eternity and a big drum to help
Buddha more clearly hear the prayers of visitors. The whole incredible
construction is completed by a 36 metre dragon made of beer bottles and broken
dishes, kneeling to worship Buddha.

Some abandoned villas at the beginning of Hung Vuong Street are also said to
shelter unusual inhabitants. Or maybe it is just a mountain wind disturbing
old wooden floors or the voices of the past that donâ€™t want to leave the
city.  
Those visitors who like to find the authentic features of truly Vietnamese
culture in Dalat that do exist in fact and live happily with General European
look of the city should visit Tau (Chinese) Pagoda on Khe Sanh Street, where a
small, self-revolving wooden table of uncertain provenance found its home. It
revolves independently according to visitorâ€™s orders, without them even
touching it. The most amazing about this is that it understands all languages.  
Its â€˜younger brotherâ€™, another magic table (yes, there are two) can be
found in the small house, next to Tau Pagoda on the left. The owner of the
second magic table says her father brought it from Qui Nhon, where he had
bought it from Chinese merchants at the beginning of the last century. The
owner is sure that the table brings luck to the family and she is very
grateful to this unusual family member made of wood for providing her a
constant income from tourists coming to see the local small miracle.  
The living history in Dalat seems to look through the windows of old villas,
to pass just behind your back, touching you lightly with the hands in velvet
gloves. The spirit of the close past here sometimes is so dense that one can
catch a perfume of old candles, the smoke of pinewoods from some old
fireplace, a sweet perfume of Chanel, and hear a distant sound of gramophone
playing tango, or the klaxon of some old Peugeot.  
The recent past that hasnâ€™t yet had enough time to leave Dalat; it has just
stopped, deep in its thoughts, to observe its lands for the last time before
quitting. Walk along old French villas on Tran Hung Dao and Hung Vuong streets
at dusk, and youâ€™ll feel how the past, coming together with dense night fog,
fills the air with mystery.

Vietnamâ€™s top specialist in cultural heritage conservation, Prof Hoang Dao
Kinh, told a seminar on Dalat architecture in 2004 that: â€˜There is a museum
of French architecture in Dalatâ€™.  
Architect Hoang Dao Kinh was not the first person to have voiced that opinion.
Many European architects had similar remarks once they set foot in Dalat.  
When proposing to build the city of Dalat, Dr. Yersin, Dr. Tardif and
Indochinaâ€™s Governor General Paul Doumer all wanted this city to be a
special one, unlike any other Asian city. They wanted it to fit in well with
nature.  
Architecture is the soul of a city. For the construction of Dalat, French
governor Paul Doumer brought in talented and famous planners and architects
from France, and he himself watched closely over the process. Paul Doumer
envisioned for Dalat to be a typical highland city, adhering entirely the
motif of the likes of highland cities in Europe, and at the same time, a
natural sanctuary. In 1921, Ernest HÃ©brard, a world-renowned architect, was
charged with planning Dalat city.  
To make Dalat the capital of Indochina colony, HÃ©brardâ€™s main philosophy
was to concentrate residence areas around lakes (there is a chain of eight
lakes: Xuan Huong, Than Tho and six others along Cam Ly spring). Accordingly,
there would be military zones, hospitals, schools, sport facilities,
administrative buildings and parks around Lake Xuan Huong, Vietnamese
residence areas, areas for villas of the French, hospitals, and markets. After
HÃ©brardâ€™s plan, there were others proposed by architects Pineau (1933),
Mondet (1940) and J. Lagisquet (1942), but only that of Lagisquet was approved
by the authorities. The common feature of the four architects was the respect
for nature, attempting to preserve the natural beauty. The city opened its
view to the Langbian peak, with non-edificial zones such as the pine grove
along the Prenn road, the hills to the north of Da Thien, the Pin Thouard hill
and the north-east of Lake Xuan Huong. According to the design of Lagisquet,
the whole Dalat was designed to be a garden. Not following this principle is
betraying nature, because this is the only suitable way. HÃ©brard and
Lagisquet are considered the creators of the soul of Dalat of those days.

Note that at that time, while in Hanoi and Saigon, the French only paid
attention to the architecture of some big buildings, such as the Governor
Generalâ€™s Palace, Resident Superior Palace, Governorâ€™s Palace, City Hall,
the post office, the Opera House, banks, and museums, but in Dalat, even the
smallest construction projects had to be approved by the Governor General. The
city planners were also handpicked by him. HÃ©brardâ€™s and Lagisquetâ€™s main
proposals also had to be approved by a decree of the Governor General in order
to be realized. The planning was extremely meticulous and detailed.  
HÃ©brard and subsequently, Lagisquet have puffed into a wilderness the soul of
a city that the French had to admit was unique in the Far-East. Among over
2,000 old French villas in Dalat, I have visited the 1,000 oldest ones, which
are considered representative of the far-away French architecture of the end
of the 19th century.  
From the very first thatched cottage built in 1883 for 30 Vietnamese soldiers
to 10 Chalet style wooden houses, by 1930 (after finishing HÃ©brardâ€™s
project), 398 big, â€˜very Frenchâ€™, reinforced concrete villas had been
built. Dalat expert Le Phi said , in 1937 the French began to promote Dalat as
a centre for tourism, culture, science, and hunting. In realizing
Lagisquetâ€™s plan (1943) after the HÃ©brard stage, many more urban structures
were developed, and the number of villas reached 743. When Dalat became Bao
Daiâ€™s, the last Vietnamese Kingâ€™s land in 1949, the number of villas had
surpassed 1,000. No two villas looked exactly alike; each building is a
perfect piece of imaginative and romantic architecture, adding to the features
of the mountains and forests surrounding Dalat. Villas no. 14, 18, 20 (on
todayâ€™s Tran Hung Dao street) mimic northern French architecture (wooden
sides, brick walls), but the faÃ§ades and space arrangements are different
from one another. The villas near the end of Ly Thai To or Quang Trung streets
have block architecture in the Southern French style (the faÃ§ade curves down
like a bow, tiled roofs, edged with curved tiles, give it an antique look,
there are big rooms with timber floors, porches with one stair on the left and
an elevated hind part). The ones on Co Giang Street follow the style of the
Basque region in the south-east of France; small houses with tilted roofs;
from the outside they look like palaces, but they have simple and compact
interiors. On the other hand, the public buildings such as the Geography House
(the Map Department of Dalat today), the LycÃ©e Yersin (The Pedagogical
College of Dalat today), and the Dalat railroad station look like those of the
central part of France; big, tilted roof and stone walls, heavy-looking but
very airy, with a lot of light and a reasonable interior lay-out; big
buildings often have a corridor in the middle with a door to each room.  
After the French era, the American and the southern Vietnamese regime, during
the 1960s and the first half of 1970s, continued to follow the guidelines of
HÃ©brard and Lagisquet. Many new buildings were constructed, but the old ones
remained unmistakably distinct. These are the villas, always with a flower
garden, distantly separated, having wide views in beautiful and romantic
directions: to the pine groves, to the valley, to the Langbian peak, or to the
99 high spots in the city. All of these villas hide themselves under the pine
trees and none has more than three floors, in order not to obstruct the
natural view.

Xuan Huong Lake in its early days.  
 _Photo provided by Nguyen Hang Tinh  
_  
In this city that has stepped out from the wild highlands, history, as well as
all other things, has reflected upon Xuan Huong Lake ever since it took shape
early in the previous century.  
Who among the people of Dalat could get through each day without encountering
Xuan Huong Lake? Whenever they hit the streets, they must pass by, go around,
or face the famous splendid lake, which has been ranked as a national heritage
site.  
I consider the lake the yin of Dalat, in comparison to the yang of the hills
and mountains. At the lake transpire days so sunny and beautiful that they
seem to take place out in the wilds, even though the lake is right in the
middle of the city. I often direct my thoughts at it in order to purify myself
in a natural space. One day, I realized that the lake wasnâ€™t an inanimate
object, but rather it was a piece of the human world.  
As for the highland city, many times Iâ€™ve visualized it lying neatly within
the palm of my hand, with Xuan Huong Lake as the navel. With this city,
thereâ€™s a fortuitous coincidence that corresponds with people; the navel is
the point of reproductive inception. Only with premeditation was action taken
during the founding of Dalat City. The first thing that they did was to
deliberately set up a lake. The sudden fantastic inspiration of civil engineer
LabbÃ© and the envoy Cunhac to hold back the flow of Lach Spring in 1919 is a
feat that is still unmatched anywhere else in Vietnam. Lach Spring became
Grand Lac and then Xuan Huong Lake, as it is called today. The business of
creating a lake was so important that it was granted focused attention and
conducted through planning, organization, and solicitous design. It was done
before constructing houses and roads, and prior to bringing people there to
live. In Vietnam, there are two lakes that are the heart of the city and the
eyes through which the ecology is balanced and the world is viewed. Whereas
Guom Lake (a.k.a. Hoan Kiem Lake) in Hanoi was created by nature, Xuan Huong
Lake is the creation of mankind.  
One hundred twenty years have passed since Dalat was born and everything in
Dalat has changed, from the cityâ€™s layout to its denizensâ€™ hearts – with
the exception of Xuan Huong Lake. Many governments have passed through the
body of Dalat, but unfathomably, no power has dared to touch it. Regardless of
abundant truculence, none ever managed to succeed. For instance, as a
preponderance of people from all over planned to stake out and occupy the
surface of the water in order to create business premises, Thanh Thuy
Restaurant was constructed as a multi-storey building, and a cafÃ© was built
as an extension to the outside of Thuy Ta Restaurantâ€™s architecture. Whoever
messed with Xuan Huong Lake was disdained by the people. It may be just a
lake, but it is deferentially revered.

_  
Residents here reserve a corner of their hearts for Xuan Huong Lake. It seems
that the people of Dalat adore Xuan Huong Lake as much as they treasure Cu
Hill – despite the fact that this stretch of hills has been â€˜married offâ€™
to foreigners in order to make a golf course such that the people no longer
have a chance to disport there. Xuan Huong Lake continues to placidly follow
the months and years, gliding along with the happy and sad destinies of
mankind. As it is the navel of the highland city, it beats in rhythm with the
human world and assumes all things to which it is exposed such as the
wastewater of hotels, carwashes, escort pubs, massage parlours, karaoke bars,
dance clubs, and the system of houses that pile up on the old hills and
mountains, which see off the pine forest on its separate way. While algae may
propagate day by day and pile up over the sunny spaces, Xuan Huong Lake still
determines spots that glisten. While valley creeks upstream have allowed the
people of this world to demarcate plots of land and fill them in, Xuan Huong
Lake continues to extend its breast to take in all wayward things. Xuan Huong
Lake tolerates all sins. Condoms may be tossed by certain people down into the
lake, yet it still appears hallowed, meting out in plenty the remembrances of
the people of the world.  
The lake has clear and murky seasons that follow the two rainy and dry
seasons. However, for the 95-year-old hunched-back immigrant from Hue, who
always bears an antiquated rickety camera in front of his chest, it is
precisely this lake that has countenanced his family for three generations.
And the lake brooks not just the old peripatetic photographer, but also to the
cigarette stalls, the shoulder poles bearing soy milk, and the corn and sweet
potato grills that are withdrawn beneath the leaves of withering Samu trees on
gelid nights; it belongs to young female townsfolk, as well as the furtive
steps of anonymous errant lasses, who continue to quietly assume a single hue
of industriousness, physical exertion, and meek probity. These latter are
industrious but possess radiant self-respect; they would not commit evil,
dishonest or craven deeds. To be human and â€˜sell oneâ€™s body so as to feed
oneâ€™s mouthâ€™ entails a certain integrity that rests a distant step from
that of â€˜speaking oneâ€™s mouth to nourish the body.â€™ The two posh
restaurants, Thuy Ta and Thanh Thuy, have sat on the lake for almost one
hundred years, yet many of the gardeners there have lived out nearly their
entire lives without once setting foot inside, since one meal in that place is
usually equivalent to half a tonne of cabbage.

The people of Dalat are mostly good citizens, who lead slow-paced lives.
Whether well-off or rich, they are natural, easy going, and relaxed.
Naturally, they dream of becoming gentle individuals, are rarely given to
vice, and seldom avaricious. The city is not large, but the people of Dalat
have long lived â€˜the street lifeâ€™ more than those in other places. They
donâ€™t follow â€˜the flockâ€™ and seldom pay attention to sharing a common
native origin or belonging to the same clique. Those nouveaux riche with a
preponderance of assets are new immigrants who, over a few decades, had the
clout, muscle, and/or awareness of the times to arrive in order to seek
immediate profits, not to open their breasts in adoration of Dalat. The Dalat
people, having â€˜originated from the pines,â€™ arenâ€™t fond of competing
over superiority and inferiority. It is remarkable that throughout the past
history of the mountainous streets, no native of Dalat has ever led political
sway over the place. Itâ€™s not that Dalat people arenâ€™t intelligent enough
to possibly accomplish that, but rather because they have no such predilection
and designs, and opportunities to do so were also uncertain. They may live in
the mountains, but as for the people of Dalat, no one would rate them as
country men.  
Regardless of how lavish the scale of the houses on Xuan Huong Lake may be on
the inside, outside, at the edge of the grass at the side of the road, are
good-natured (or too-lazy-to-work) city lads who still elegantly cast fishing
hooks for foreign tourists to gaze at, wide-eyed with pleasure.  
Couples still tightly embrace one another so as to take their minds off the
cold and enjoy the redolence of the most beautiful of times in human life.
This place remains an unmanufactured area, as in the very beginning when
Erhest HÃ©brard, the French architect, set up the development trajectory of
Dalat in 1924. Xuan Huong Lake, in the eyes of HÃ©brard and Lagisquet, was the
eye of Dalat, a pearl amid the scenic city. If it were not so, then Xuan Huong
Lake would not have become an urban work of art, and Dalat would not have
become such a renowned city so rapidly and enduringly.  
The pleasure of beholding the silhouette of the pine forest reflected on the
lakeâ€™s surface or the protruding bridges sparsely sprawled over the face of
the water – indeed, those are the product of Dalat alone. If it were not so,
then the foremost poet Han Mac Tu, in the winter of 1941, would not have had
sufficient material with which to encapsulate the spirit of Dalat to the
degree that it could enduringly rival the worldâ€™s talents by writing:  
â€˜Stay silent! Donâ€™t speak so much  
So as to hear the soughing from the bottom  
of the lake  
So as to listen to the rustling of willow wisps  
in the wind  
And so as to watch the sky expound the  
meaning of loveâ€¦â€™  
It would be difficult to untangle this world of emotion, such as why someone
who, after half a century returned home, still like to stand beside the
protruding bridge at Xuan Huong Lake with a horse so as to â€˜modelâ€™ for a
souvenir picture, as people have done for fifty years.  
Anyone, after a journey in which their vehicle climbs up Prenn Pass and they
catch sight of Xuan Huong Lake replete with mist, would be at last satisfied
to their heartâ€™s delight [and exclaim], â€˜This is to have returned to
Dalat, to the place where â€˜the pace is not fast, speech is not clamorous,
meals are not rushed, life is not radiant, and work is not about getting
really rich.â€™ Thus, those with truly deep affection for Dalat often concern
themselves with Xuan Huong Lake, such as when they cry out at the sight of the
appearance of algae or when meritorious fellows are so devoted to Xuan Huong
Lake that they are infatuated and audaciously transform its rockery,
transporting stones and aged trees from down in the torrid Dai Ninh River of
the Duc Trong tropics back to plant all around the lakeside.  
The people retort, â€˜Up in the mountains, whatâ€™s the point of making
artificial mountains!?â€™ The leaders of Lam Dong Province, of which Dalat is
a part, unfathomably gave the okay to real estate investors from Saigon to
come and clear out 15ha on the southern bank of Xuan Huong Lake along Ba Huyen
Thanh Quan Street in order to set up a string of hotels, villas, and
nightclubs. This aesthetically unsound idea compelled the people of Dalat to
respond, and the successive government had to extend its hand in
â€˜rectificationâ€™ when it repealed the decision of the preceding officials
so as to return the space to the proper use of rendering the dreaminess of the
flowers, verdant trees, and couples in love. It is questionable whether the
stretch of landscape below the visage of the pen-tower of the Dalat
Pedagogical College of Dalat actually becomes a â€˜Garden of Extraordinary
Flowers and Outstanding Plants,â€™ yet over the last three years, it has laid
out there motionless, looking piteous. A number of people arbitrarily, without
clarifying its veracity, upon hearing rumours that the pine forest in front of
the Palace Hotel might be set aside for hotels and urgently brought cameras to
take pictures of the original space as a keepsake.  
I still prefer sitting on the edge of the grass along the banks of Xuan Huong
Lake to using transportation and spinning around it. Like everyone else, I too
readily sense the birth of the effeminate cityâ€™s boisterousness. There are
two existential images that constitute the interest value of the highland
city: the pen-tower of the Yersin LyceÃ© School, which incites soaring
aspirations into the azure sky in the east, and the bell tower of â€˜Chicken
Cathedralâ€™ (a.k.a. Dalat Cathedral) in the south. The elegant and
particularly magnificent weathercock, along with the old pen-tower, is drowned
out before so many other mediocre structures that sprout up grandiosely.  
Iâ€™ve had the occasion of sitting, watching, and quietly listening to the
trot of horses bearing paddy in Tuy Hoa, Phu Yen, and crossing Da Rang Bridge,
and horses carrying grapes and garlic through the ancient Hoa Lai Cham Temples
in Phan Rang, Ninh Thuan, but somehow I still find the patter of trotting
horses along Xuan Huong Lake more musical. The horsesâ€™ trot in the Tuy Hoa
and Phan Rang regions is ponderous with suffering, dirt and toil, while in
Dalat, it conveys an errant sojourning quality that is noble and refined.
Thus, at times when they forbid horse carriages from running along its banks,
Xuan Huong Lake suddenly seemed to perish, despite the fact that high-voltage
streetlights still blanketed it with illumination – thatâ€™s how it is!  
Also in this location at Xuan Huong Lake, people find that the hotels and new
houses have, over just the last ten years, suddenly swallowed up the hills and
mountains, and even the curved, indistinct, and gentle mountain roads. All the
remaining sparse forests in the central area are suddenly being cleared away,
with cement replacing the pines. The undeveloped areas are now also turning
into streets and districts. The view out towards Langbian Mountain is
gradually closing in. The characteristic tall and short mansions that hover
around the sides of these roads seem as though houses have closed the curtains
around them and they are no longer visible. Just sitting there, one recognizes
that the â€˜motorcycle civilizationâ€™ is overrunning the highlands and
growing denser by the day, stifling the fine scenery and predominating over
modes of transportation that are benign towards the environment.  
Waves of â€˜face masksâ€™ daily carry away the smiles that are inherently
inscribed on the lips and cheeks of the highland cityâ€™s svelte lasses, who
are famed for their peach-rose cheeks. Of course, even at present, Dalat
continues to be regarded as the solitary rare and pleasantly cool city still
left in Vietnam. The six kilometre perimeter of the famous poetic lake will
continue to refract the many colours of life along with the affairs of the
world and it will witness more of the mountainous streetsâ€™ permutations.
Various changes that are sound, earnest, and befit nature will bring peace of
mind to the city. However, if they bear a wayward, imitative, and grasping
character, then they will surely make the city disingenuous, fluster the
masses, and, in the idiom of todayâ€™s youths, tempt fate.

Alexandre Yersin, who is credited for discovering Dalat, was born on 9
September, 1863 in Switzerland. He studied medicine and then went to France to
work in Pasteurâ€™s laboratory. Later, he received French citizenship. At the
end of 1889, Dr Yersin moved to Indochina to be a physician for the
Messageries Maritimes Shipping Company. Thereafter, he began to discover the
wild mountain forest regions in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.  
After three consecutive expeditions, Dr Yersin found the Langbian Plateau. On
21 June, 1893, standing before the magnificent scenery at a height of over
1,500 metres above sea level, he expressed his thoughts and feelings as
follows: â€˜My impression was quite profound when I crossed through and out
off the pine forest. I was facing a vast plateau that was denuded and bare. It
appeared like a violently agitated sea, owing to a sort of billowing
undulations with a bluish hue. The massive Langbian mountain range stood
imposingly on the horizon northwest of the plateau, accentuating the beauty of
the landscape and stood out in prominent relief against a splendid
background.â€™  
(I sense that I have not been able to entirely translate the exceptional
nature of the authorâ€™s words, so I venture to copy his original text: â€˜Mon
impression a Ã©tÃ© profonde lorsque, dÃ©bouchant de la forÃªt de pins, je me
suis trouvÃ© en face de ce vaste plateau denude et desert, donâ€™t
lâ€™apparence rappelait celle dâ€™une mer bouleversÃ©e par une houle Ã©morme
dâ€™ondulation vertes. Les massif du Lang-bian se dressant Ã lâ€™horizon nord-
ouest de plateau, accentuait la beautÃ© de site en lui donnant de relief et en
lui formant un arriÃ¨ne-plan splendideâ€™).  
In 1895, Dr Yersin founded the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang. From 1905 to
1918, he served as the director of two Pasteur Institutes in Saigon and Nha
Trang. In 1925, he was the Inspector-general of the Pasteur Institutes in
French Indochina.  
Beside medical research, Dr Yersin was also a farmer and eminent
agriculturalist. He established a garden to plant trees for experiments on
varieties of tropical plants. Species of plants like guttapercha, coca, cacao,
African oil palms, and especially a variety of Malaysian rubber tree were all
planted by Dr. Yersin with good results at the Suoi Dau plantation in Nha
Trang.  
Dr Yersin lived as a common peasant. He usually just wore beige khakis and,
although he was already eighty years old, every morning he rode a bicycle to
the Pasteur Institute. He also had a humane heart. He often utilized his free
time to further educate and develop the meek fishermen in the region where he
resided. He was even devoted to beasts and fowl and, whenever he addressed the
creatures, he would let slip the prefix â€˜fellowâ€™: fellow dog, fellow cat,
and fellow teal.

On 3 March, 1943, Dr Yersin passed away in Nha Trang. He was 80 years old. Dr
Yersinâ€™s body was laid to rest on a stretch of hills in Suoi Dau next to
rubber trees that towered straight up to the azure sky. That was precisely the
grounds that he reclaimed and broadly cultivated with nearly one hundred
hectares of land.

 **Yersin related that Captain Cupet requested that he explore the Central
Highlands and he carried out the request in 1892. He went from Ninh Hoa to
Stung Treng. In 1893, Yersin started a new expedition and this time he
discovered the Langbian Plateau.  
He used horses to explore the Dalat area. According to his diary, he came to
Prenn Falls at 1:25pm on June 21, 1893 and, at 3:30, he went up to the Dalat
highland area. He described his impressions as he set foot in the lands of
Dalat: â€˜The refreshingly cool weather made me forget my fatigue and I recall
the elatedness I felt when I ran at full speed up and down the hills, just
like a little school boy.â€™  
On his explorations of the highlands, Yersin always carried items with him
like scientific instruments, weapons, medicines, food, and some products with
which to barter. Yersin indicated that he brought a theodolite, chronometer,
pocket barometer, compass, clinical thermometer, and camera. His weapons
included a hunting gun, a Winchester 1873 model rifle, and a pistol. His food
usually included coffee, lard, cheese, milk, potatoes, and even Cognac
liquorâ€”a little of everything. Typically, the food was only enough for half
a month. When the food ran out, he had to eat Vietnamese foods. The medicine
included quinine, salol, bismuth salicyclate, Chlorodyne, idoform, phenique
acid, styrax ointment, a mercurial ointment and a case. As for the products
for bartering, they were usually fabrics in plentiful colours of white, blue,
and red, blankets, multiple colours of handkerchief, bracelets, and various
kinds of rings, knives, pipes, and watches.  
Owing to these barter products, wherever he went, he was able to rent
elephants and horses and hire guides to translate or act as liaisons with the
local dignitaries.

11/20/2019,The History of the Development of Dalat,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/the-history-of-the-development-of-dalat/,,By Han Nguyen*,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/8kghg.jpg,"_(No.11, Vol.3, Dec 2013 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

At the end of the nineteenth-century, Dalat was still a deserted place without
a single Vietnamese person. The  
founding of Dalat owed itself to the initiative of the French. In a report for
the Governor-General, Resident Mayor A. Berjoan stated, â€˜Dalat occupies a
special favorable position in the Far East. Dalatâ€™s climate, scenic
landscape, and capacity for expansion make it an advantageous place with which
no other can compareâ€¦ Dalat can and must become a recreational site in the
Far Eastâ€™s immense mountain region.â€™  
Just as the Americans founded Banguio (1,800m) in the Philippines, the British
Ootacamund (2,200m) in South India, and the Dutch Tosari in Java, the French
established the city of Dalat at an altitude of 1,500m, chiefly so that
colonial administrative officials could go up there for rest and recreation
rather than take leave back in their motherland.  
Dalat truly had the conditions to become Southeast Asiaâ€™s major vacation
centre. It lay on the expansive Langbian Plateau. The city had readily
traversable roads, a cool, crisp climate, and fertile soil, sufficient
humidity and abundant rain that provided enough for fresh trees and profuse
organisms. By air, Dalat is about 250km from Saigon and no more than 100km
from towns and critical ports, especially Cam Ranh, on the coast of the East
Sea.  
Dalat can be seen as having had gone through the following stages:  
Stage 1 â€” During the period when it was discovered by the French
(1893-1899): This was from the time that Dalat was discovered by doctor Yersin
until Governor-General P. Dourmer decided to establish a rest and recreation
site for the French in Indochina on the Langbian Plateau.  
Stage 2 â€” During its founding (1900-1914): This was the stage when P.
Dourmer decided to select Dalat rather than Dankia in the Ankroet area and on
through the successive years, in which Dalat was neglected once P. Doumer left
Indochina.  
Stage 3 â€” During the period of its rebirth (1915-1922): This stage began
when the first World War erupted and Dalat suddenly awoke after a period of
dormancy and continued up to the time when it officially became a city with
the outline and organization of a city.  
Stage 4 â€” During the period when it developed into a city (1923-1939): The
stage began when Dalat had a construction design by the architect HÃ©brard
that was ratified for implementation by the Governor-General of Indochina and
continued until Dalat saw other transformations.  
Stage 5 â€“ Dalat during the period when it flourished under French
colonialism (1940-1954): Dalat became the summer capital of Indochina.  
The place name â€˜Dalatâ€™ is an appellation that emerged from inquiring local
people. This was attested to by Mr Cu-nhac, a person who was in the first
exploration team and did research in order to establish Dalat, as well as the
person who assumed the responsibility of the first official posts in
restructuring Dalat, in addition to upper Dong Nai Province. He replied in an
interview conducted by Baudrit that was published in Revue Indochine, no. 180
as follows:  
â€˜All the way up to this year, the pristine setting has not changed. In the
place where the lake was in the past, the small stream of the Lat tribe
coursed through and people called the stream â€˜Da-Latâ€™ (da or dak has
meanings that all relate to water). Thus Dalat means the water of the Lat
people or the stream of the Lat people.  
Then Dalatâ€™s founders settled on a cleverly parsed Latin motto: â€˜Dat Aliis
Laetitiam Aliis Temperiem,â€™ which means â€˜give this fellow happiness and
another health.â€™  
Dr. Yersin said that he received a letter from Governor-General P. Doumer
sometime around 1899, requesting that the doctor search for a site in the
region south of Annam [present day Central Vietnam], where the doctor had
already made discoveries, in order to establish a vacation place that met the
following conditions; convenient altitude, sufficient area, guaranteed supply
of water, temperate climate and ready accessibility.  
Langbian Plateau was the place that had the sufficient conditions and,
naturally, Dr. Yersin recommended establishing a place for vacationing in
Dankia.  
In the beginning, the French set up a few experimental bases in Dankia, which
is about 13km to the northwest of Dalat.  
Nevertheless, after continuing to explore Dankia and Dalat in 1900, Governor-
General P. Doumer selected Dalat.  
In 1914, the road from Phan Thiet [on the central coast] to Dalat through
Djiring crossing was opened and automobiles could reach Dalat for the first
time in only half a dayâ€™s journey.  
Dalat during the period of its founding was not yet a city, but rather just a
cursory vacation spot reserved for the French.  
As for administrative establishments, at that time, only a few wooden
buildings were set up, like the Governor-Generalâ€™s residence, the hospital,
the envoyâ€™s residence, and the Indochinese Guard building. In 1907, the
first tavern was established, which later became the Hotel de Lac and which
today is the Information Office.  
P. Duclaux, a person who had ridden a horse from Vinh [in Central Vietnam] to
Saigon in 42 days and stopped by Dalat, described the scenery of Dalat in 1908
in the journal Indochine as follows:  
â€˜Dalat! Eight or ten thatched cottages with Vietnamese people, a stilt house
for long-distance travelers made of crude boards, a small water fountain, a
marketplace, and a rudimentary post office atop a hillock secluded behind a
fence in the middle of the pine forest, and a few brick buildings of Dalatâ€™s
administrative centresâ€¦â€™  
Duclaux said that at that time, Dalat had extremely numerous tigers. The
tigers always threatened and even hunters could secure nothing. The tigers
pounced on many Westerners and caught livestock, dogs, and horses. Besides
that, wolves frequently went about in vicious packs. If going out on the road
alone right when dusk lingered, it was extremely dangerous. Duclaux himself,
when he came to Dalat and went to eat dinner at a military post and then left
to go back, had Canivey give him four armed military guards.

Postcards from the early years of Dalat (Philippe Chaplain Collection)

In 1920, the road from Phan Rang [on the central coast] up to Dalat was
finally completed and work also began to set up a section of railroad from Xom
Gon up to Dalat.  
In 1916, Governor-General Roume decided to build a majestic hotel with all the
amenities. It would be the Hotel du Langbian Palace. In 1922, the Langbian
Palace hotel was opened for business.  
Around 1918, an electric power plant was built. Then in 1920, a water plant
was also built.  
In 1923, Dalat at last actually became a city, when people started to carry
out the plan by the architect HÃ©brard. The plan was entrusted by Governor-
General M. Long to the architect himself to carry out. HÃ©brard had a broad
vision. According to his design, the city could develop to a population of
300,000 residents, or possibly even more than that and, hypothetically, Dalat
would become the capital of the Indochinese Union (French Indochina).  
In 1926, public secondary schools began construction; Le Petit LycÃ©e and Le
Grand LycÃ©e. Le Petit LycÃ©e was completed in 1927 and Le Grand LycÃ©e in
1935. On June 28, 1935, the two schools were given the single joint
appellation, LycÃ©e Yersin [now the Pedagogical College of Dalat].  
In 1923, Dalat had only about ten wooden buildings. By 1938, Dalat had up to
398 villas and by 1945 up to 1,000 villas. In 1931, Dalat Cathedral was built
and later completed in 1942. In 1929, the marketplace in Anh Sang Hamlet was
moved to a location in the modern Hoa Binh area.  
Starting in 1923, Dalatâ€™s population was about 1,500 people. By 1938, the
population had risen to 9,500 people and by 1939 it reached 11,500 people,
among them 600 Frenchmen.  
When World War II occurred, it created a favorable opportunity for Dalat to
transform itself again. The war made it impossible for the French to return to
their mother country on holiday and they flocked to Dalat. The war also made
it impossible for commodities from France to be brought over to Indochina. The
French administration in Indochina had to apply a policy of self-sufficient
production. Dalat was a suitable place for the production of temperate zone
produce.  
Dalat was moreover the place that possessed the most abundant potential for
hydroelectric power. Around 1942, after a trip for an on-site survey of Ankoet
Falls, Governor-General Decoux decided to build a hydroelectric power plant
and, in 1944, the hydroelectric plant began operations.  
In 1942, a large-scale program for vegetable cultivation was implemented.
Formerly, Dalat had to purchase vegetables from neighboring areas like Don
Duong. After the program, in 1944, Dalat not only had sufficient vegetables
for consumption, but also surplus vegetables to sell, especially in the
winter.  
With these developments, Dalat crossed over into a stage of prosperity and
reached the pinnacle of its prosperity under French colonization in 1944. For
nearly half of the year, Dalat was the real capital of Indochina as the
Governor-General and virtually all important government offices relocated to
work in Dalat. By April 1944, Dalat had up to 5,600 Westerners, a record
number.  
[In 1954, the French left Indochina, and Dalat began a new period of
development.]

All along the 220 km from the celebrated resort village of Mui Ne to the no-
less-popular seaside retreat of Nha Trang city, the highway races neck and
neck with the coastline and vast spaces of the sea under the spotless sky, all
together forming a five-hour continuum of bright deep blue and bursting yellow
for one to behold. At sunset, the bus rolls out on the part of the road cut
out through the rocks and perched high above the sea. Itâ€™s where the
magnificent panorama of an overwhelmingly huge bay rises to oneâ€™s view in
all its splendor. The colossal, still body of the sea at ebbâ€“tide lying far
below makes one feel like nothing less than riding along the very rim of a
solid universe. After 10 minutesâ€™ ride from the mesmerizing tropical sea
abyss, I arrive in the sumptuous lobby of Diamond Bay Resort & Spa, its vast
interior expanses pillared with columns, dÃ©cor and furnishing reminding one
of Heathrowâ€™s VIP Lounge, with fine blooms of colonial chic sophisticatedly
added by cozy rattan cushions, ripe cherry-coloured bamboo shutters instead of
traditional floor-to-ceiling glass windows and cheerful green rice sprouts in
pots on the coffee-tables. A shopping arcade and big travel bureau stand were
also there to strengthen the chic terminal association. Check-in took no more
than five minutes. With a â€˜boarding passâ€™ comprising of the room key card
and a whole bunch of full board meal vouchers in one hand and a map of Diamond
Bay Resort handed to me by the ever-so-amiable guest relations manager in the
other, I proceed by electrical car through the mighty tropical ocean of resort
gardens to the junior suite where Iâ€™m booked. The cheery liveried driver
motors me along broad alleys that actually look more like real streets of some
seaside town framed with long rows of palm trees with families of guests
strolling under the noble-looking street lights.  
The resort area is truly expansive, with exquisite four-star accommodations,
featuring 176 rooms, ranging from Garden Superior and Deluxe to Junior and
Executive suites in four three-story hotel blocks and 164(!!!) bungalows
comprising Ocean View and VIP Diamond Jacuzzi bungalows â€¦ all of them
nestled in the lush gardens, with half of these last overlooking the sea. To
ensure the utter comfort and to provide memorable pleasures of the guestsâ€™
pastime at such an impressive institution are three elegant restaurants, four
bars, a night club and cinema, a state-of-the art seaside 18 hole golf course
with stylish golf clubhouse attached and all of this is just for starters.
There are many more exquisite facilities that are asking to be immediately
depicted.  
On arrival to my suite on the first floor, I was really impressed by the
elegant spacious living room furnished in mild rococo style, cozy bedroom and
two large balconiesâ€“verandahs overlooking the palm garden with all amenities
you would expect of a luxury hotel (plus the faint but oh-so-familiar and
nostalgia-provoking odor of Russian salami from the minibar â€“ an obvious
trace of provident compatriots staying there before me).  
The Universe Restaurant, which I managed to find in the forest of a garden
exclusively by means of resort map, was also very impressive, with its
expansive and throne-room like interiors and â€˜royal householdâ€™ musicians
behind a piano and with violin in hand also being present. The dinner
smorgasbord on display, with long rows of seafood delicacies, European and
local dishes galore, promised a true culinary feerie to broaden oneâ€™s palate
on and eventually exceeded my high expectations. Hats off to the Chief Cook of
Diamond Bay Resort & Spa, a natural seafood taste and ingredients aficionado,
who won my heart forever with rustic-style calamari skewers and opened up for
me an unforgettable taste of sautÃ©ed octopus in thick tomato bath. This
octopus-tasting experience was quite different from one in Japan, where a
trained staff stands behind guestsâ€™ back ready to tear off the octopus stuck
to a dinerâ€™s tongue in its last pre-death spasm. The culinary side of
oneâ€™s stay at Diamond Bay Resort & Spa provides a truly healthy and
flavourful whole-day buffet option at Universe and Rosy restaurants and can be
easily turned into a slow food course to rehabilitate oneâ€™s precious self
after a year of workdayâ€™s hectic meals. There are quite a lot of local
dishes to indulge in and to excite oneâ€™s palate and senses, including
jellyfish salad, great soups, fresh tropical fruits and desserts with waffles,
pannacotta with kiwi and exotic sweet banana soup.  
There is almost no limit to what visitors can explore and enjoy during their
stay. The property features a massive 3000m² free-form pool by the sea for a
swim under the stars to remember, a modern fitness center in the glass
pavilion to work all the bountiful buffets off, private beach with kayaks and
catamarans to spend a great time with kids, many hectares of lush gardens to
explore on foot or on a bicycle and a spa centre for total relaxation and
rejuvenation. Song Lo Spa Centre, with its extensive spa treatments featuring
120 minutes total revival chakra treatment, 90 minutes massage â€˜a quatre
mainsâ€™ with Indian fragrant oils, chocolate wraps and herbs hair masks, all
performed by skilled masters, deserves high praise. Besides an expansive and
intriguing spa menu, the Song Lo Spa Centre boasts truly relaxing and
harmonious interiors with labyrinths of wooden shutters and passages with
garlands of living orchids in pots and lily ponds, leading to secluded massage
rooms luring enough to be lost in for several days in a row.  
The indulgent spa experience can be varied yet further with the 100 Egg mud
bath cum eco-park institution, also belonging to the property. 10 quick
minutes on a resort shuttle bus and one is in a fairy-tale world built amid
green hills, offering the true adventure of taking a mineral mud bath in the
mind- blowing egg form tube in the open air, while contemplating the riot of
tropical greenery. Apart from exotic balneological treatment served in a giant
egg tube, 100 Egg Center offers interesting hiking and walking options plus
tasty and exotic treats for a perfect picnic with family. On site, 100 Egg
Restaurant with 100 dishes made of eggs, egg coffee included, is definitely
worth a visit as well.  
Diamond Bay Resort & Spa is a truly impressive four-star international
standard seaside retreat with an array of activities and facilities meant for
total relaxation to finish oneâ€™s trip through Vietnam or to start it in an
impressive way.

11/20/2019,Pothi Somron Pagoda in Can Tho,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/pothi-somron-pagoda-in-can-tho/,,Text and photo by Kim Dung,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/hinh-5-a.jpg,"_(No.9, Vol.3, Oct 2013 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/hinh-5-a.jpg)  
A statue at Pothi Somron Pagoda, Can Tho

In contrast to many other Buddhist pagodas, Pothi Somron conveys a rich
communal character. The main chamber and pillar stÅ«pas were built on a space
of modest area. The remaining large areas were reserved for shared activities,
such as preparing for festivals, activities relating to the arts, sports, and
recreation.  
Situated next to National Highway 91, Pothi Somron Pagoda in O Mon District in
the city of Can Tho in the Mekong Delta is 277 years old. Pothi Somron Pagoda
was built for the first time out of leafy trees. In 1856, the pagoda was
rebuilt out of precious wood and roofed with scaled tiles that reflected an
influence from the cultures of Khmer and India. Almost 100 years later, the
pagoda had degenerated badly when the monk Thach Khieng, the resident abbot at
that time, went over to Phnom Penh to invite a Cambodian architect to draft a
design for restoring the pagoda, one that was based on retaining its
traditional architecture. Completed in 1952, the pagoda was built with stone
bricks and has been maintained to this day.  
It can be seen that the main chamber is the outstanding piece among the
architectural arrangement of Pothi Somron Pagoda. The main chamber was built
with high ceilings and has four broad corridors extending out in each
direction, which, according to Hinduism, is considered an arrangement that
looks out towards the four directions of the universe. The main door turns out
to the east, since the Khmer believe that although Buddha abides in the
Western Paradise, he always faces the east in order to deliver all sentient
beings.  
The roof of the main chamber is done in three overlapping layers with dragons
running along the edges of the roof, their tails stretching straight up to the
sky. Surrounding the corridors are rows of pillars, four of which are affixed
with the divine Krud bird holding a jewel in its mouth and intertwined with
Kennar heavenly damsels. Geometric patterns and water hyacinths were
meticulously engraved on the walls, stairs, bases of the pillars, railings,
doorframes, roofs, and partitions to create a unique temple that is steeped in
the cultural character of the Khmer.  
Khmer Buddhist pagodas all have pillar stÅ«pas, which every family in the
community builds to enshrine relativesâ€™ ashes after they pass away.
Nevertheless, it is rare for a pagoda to still retain a stÅ«pa that is over
200 years old like Pothi Somron. The stÅ«pas were built out of Lindera myrrha,
laterite, and bricks. They hold the remains of many Buddhists and have
preserved them over many generations. The pagoda still retains many ancient
objects, such as around 100 Satra scriptures (texts written on leaves), wooden
sparrow wings from the year 1856 that are engraved with images from the
stories of ÅšÄkyamuni Buddha and nearly 20 wooden statues, which are also
from the nineteenth-century through to the present.  
In contrast to Buddhist pagodas that practice MahÄyÄna Buddhism, the
Khmerâ€™s TheravÄdin Pothi Somron Pagoda conveys a pervasive communal
character and includes a capacious space that is reserved for shared
activities. The vegetarian canteen is a room which bonzes in the pagoda can
utilize as a place to eat and drink, but its main function is still to allow
the secular population to gather for activities or even as a place to sleep if
they have come from afar. Frequently, the monastics chant sÅ«tras in the main
chamber while common folk continue to dance and sing outside in the courtyard
or in the vegetarian canteen. Furthermore, the pagoda is a place for many
social events such as campaigns to construct compassion homes for ethnic Khmer
compatriots or to assist in the collection of valuable artefacts. Not only is
the pagoda a sacred institution for the Buddha Dharma (Buddhist teachings) for
local Khmer compatriots, it is also a familiar place among the people of Can
Tho whenever numerous cultural and social events take place. The pagoda
contributes to enriching the material and spiritual lives of the people. The
resident abbot there relates that in the years of resistance against the
French and Americans, the pagoda was a place that helped and sheltered many
youths avoid enemy armies, as well as one that allowed them a place to stay
and practice devotion for extended periods of time.  
Standing in a corner of the pagoda at the foot of the vo uu (no worry) tree,
which is said to have been brought from India in 1969, I sensed a refined,
mild fragrance. â€˜Khmer Buddhists regard mothers and fathers with the utmost
importance as was taught by the Buddha. Therefore, during their lives,
children must treat their parents well and requite the filial love of those
who gave birth and raised them. Before the age of 21, males set aside time to
enter a pagoda and practice monasticism. That is also a way in which the Khmer
people express filial piety towards their parents,â€™ a monk explained.  
By immersing myself in its contemplative atmosphere when I arrived at Pothi
Somron Pagoda, I beheld its unique architecture and sensed the intimate life
among the pagoda and the community. I was also moved by the fact that, of all
the architecture, only one stÅ«pa that enshrines crematory remains still
endures, retaining the mossy features of time. Aside from that, gold and red
have come to coat the architecture in the pagoda, thereby vivifying the
colours within this verdant space next to the O Mon river mouth after the
pagoda had been restored and recognized as a national heritage site.

Cannon along waterfront

Undoubtedly, the best way to get to know a city is on foot. The trouble in Ho
Chi Minh City is that walking is regarded as eccentric behaviour in which only
foreigners would engage. The pavements have been commandeered by hawkers.
Obstacles such as rubbish dumps, chairs from improvised eating stalls and
clumsily parked motorbikes hinder your progress and even force you onto the
road. Some motorcyclists also drive on the pavements and will even have the
shamefaced gall to honk at the pedestrian to give way. I have also had a bag
snatched by a pavement rider. I am happy to inform you his heist was a
sandwich and some photocopied â€˜Letâ€™s Goâ€™ books for young learners of
English. Yet there is one pleasant urban walk that is nothing but a joy and
which will provide you with insight into the lives of local people as well as
into the origins of this great commercial megapolis. I am happy to share this
with you here.  
The stroll at a leisurely pace will take you around thirty-five minutes. All
along the way, you will enjoy scenes of river life with its multifarious
vessels from ocean liners to dugouts and the banks of Districts Two and Four.
Should you stop for refreshment from the many vendors and cafes along the way
and should you engage in conversation with the locals-many of whom are all too
eager to practice their English-your ramble could turn into several enjoyable
hours.  
It starts abruptly in a shady corner which has an improvised tea stand
opposite the Ton Duc Thang museum on the street of the same name. In amongst a
file of coconut palms you can see cannon and grappling guns at defence of the
river. Huge rock cannon balls stand to attention at their sides. Also, this is
the end of the repair dock for ocean-going vessels and you can observe welders
at work. This first one-hundred-metre section is a popular place for fishing
and a rendezvous point for Saigoners looking for rest and relaxation. You will
find a lot of motorbikes, but they are harmlessly stationary and quite neatly
parked.  
Section two is a large bonsai garden cum nursery which also has a waterside
restaurant on its premises. There is a large pond which has enough colourful
flowers planted around it to attract beautiful butterflies. After this, there
is a booth and wharf belonging to a sightseeing and dinner cruise company.
Then there is a river police station with river police boats docked alongside
it.  
You now are forced briefly to walk alongside the road and you come to section
three, now calm, but a few years back was eternally thronged with our dear
friends the Saigon motorbikes. This was the Thu Thiem ferry to District Two.
Now it is another river cruise wharf and the building is a restaurant. On the
other side of the road is the Riverside Hotel, which I had barely noticed
before passing by on foot or in a vehicle. From this aspect you can enjoy its
facade of classical friezes with its nymphs and cherubim. At the top, there is
a placard in Vietnamese indicating that this old colonial building was
originally The Saigon Cong Thuong Bank. There is a date given-1954.  
Then again, after a few roadside steps, you turn into further gardens. Here
berthed you will find two floating restaurants. The first is a converted
passenger ship which features a sharkâ€™s mouth bow. At a gateway, there is an
announcement of one-hour river cruises departing nightly, Chinese, Vietnamese
and European dishes and live performances of traditional Vietnamese and modern
music on separate floors. The second ship, clearly named La Perle de
Lâ€™Orient (Pearl of the Orient, the old nickname for this city) is a three-
tiered Chinese junk which could have been hauled from Halong Bay. Also from
this standpoint, you get an excellent view of Saigonâ€™s tallest building, the
soaring Bitexco Tower. At the end of this section is the popular resting place
marked Cafe Kem.  
Section five with its ATM machines will briefly bring you back to a more
normal reality as taxi drivers and touts hustle for your custom. This is the
Vung Tau high-speed ferry terminal. Thankfully, this lasts for a mere fifty
metres. There is another ornate classic hotel frontage to be enjoyed; that of
The Majestic Hotel, child of the â€˜art decoâ€™ era.  
Inevitably, there needs to be a space to store the two-wheelers and section
seven is a motorbike park; thankfully well-ordered. It is built around some
small gardens.  
Coming to part seven there is tiny port for small vessels only and then you
come across the berth for one of the new wonders of Vietnam; a huge Chinese
junk worthy of the explorer Cheng Ho, complete with gossamer sails, a top deck
house and an even higher poop deck. You need to time you arrival well, as the
junk is in dock here only after three p.m. in the afternoon. If you miss it,
you will still be able to see it further along alongside the Ho Chi Minh
Museum across the water in District Four.  
You walk alongside the road again and the last and longest part of your stroll
is clearly demarcated by a most welcome low-lying set of chains to keep out
motorbikes. I met very few people on this half-mile. There were some girls
walking their chihuahua, some lone fishermen and a group of boys playing
football. I hardly felt I was in the heart of a big city.  
Then, a gem of a discovery which I have never seen in the guide books. In
amongst a shrubbery garden, there is a small yellow rotunda building with the
national flag flying proudly from a tall mast. I went up to it for close
inspection and there is an exhibition of panoramic photographs of this section
of the river now and in former times all around it. The flag is significant. I
had stumbled upon the old semaphore station. There is a notice at the door
explaining it was built in 1865 just before the invention of radio and
restored in 1900.  
It is situated at the junction of the main river and a tributary. This would
have been a very crowded waterway and some form of communication with shore
was vital.  
With District Four now on the other bank and buildings such as the Ho Chi Minh
Museum and the City Law University in view, you pass under the arches of the
recently built Khanh Hoi Bridge. The well-tended gardens are now very wide and
the red brick pathway is flanked by dark green lamp posts from another time.
Looking across the road, there are neo-classical bank buildings. This is the
very essence of the existence of this city. It was born as the commercial hub
for the immensely rich-at least agriculturally speaking-Mekong region and once
you got your goods to these many wharves the banks had to be at hand in order
to settle accounts.  
Some may lament the fact that the banks of this smaller watercourse have, in
recent years, been cleared of hundreds of houses on stilts that were part of
the atmosphere of old Saigon and now can be seen only in photographs, but you
have in its place a beautiful walkway and a haven of peace.  
I chose to end my walk at a stunning cantilever bridge, a further legacy of
the French. It is painted bright green and is now for pedestrians only and
closed to vehicles. In the early years of this century, this was the main
bridge to the south and I remember it was absolutely and constantly chock-a-
bloc with traffic. By the bridge, there is a huge block of a modern building.
There is no indication what it is, but I approached and heard a loud humming
noise. I assume it is a power station. The pathway goes on for miles and the
more adventurous may chose to wander and explore further.  
I hope you have enjoyed my description of an urban stroll without tears.
Should you undertake to walk it yourself, you will not fail to enjoy the daily
life of Saigon both on land and river. You will also gain an intense
appreciation of the history and origins of this vibrant city at this point
where land, river and easy access to the sea are at their optimum point for
commerce. Oh, and do not forget to take it in your stride and have a chat with
the locals and partake of a nice cup of coffee and an ice cream along the way.
Bonne promenade!

11/20/2019,Tea and sympathy with the zen mistress of Bamboo Village,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/tea-and-sympathy-with-the-zen-mistress-of-bamboo-village/,,By Pip de Rouvray ,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/GA2013_386.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Baboom-ed.jpg,"_(No.8, Vol.3, Sep 2013 Vietnam Heritage Magazine,Advertorial)_

A glass of soothing green Vietnamese tea was set before me and I immediately
felt at ease. It was clear from the beginning that this was going to be a
conversation and not an interview. I was in the company of that rare kind of
person who, after only a few minutes talking, makes you feel as if you have
known her for years. I had no trouble communicating with Mrs Ngo Thanh Loan,
as she is fluent in English, holding both American and Vietnamese passports
and dividing her time between the two lands. She is the original creative
inspiration and the driving force behind The Bamboo Village Beach Resort & Spa
at Mui Ne, Phan Thiet. This award-winning four-star hotel, one of the first to
appear on this lovely stretch of the coastline, is to celebrate its fifteenth
birthday in September. I was chatting with her at their sales office in HCMC
to try to find out what makes her tick.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/GA2013_386.jpg)_  
**Mrs Ngo Thanh Loan, the President of Bamboo Village Beach  
Resort & Spa, receives the Certificate of Excellence for the resort awarded by
The Guide in August, 2013  
**  
I asked Mrs Loan from where she had taken her ideas for Bamboo Village.
â€˜Well,â€™ she replied, â€˜I spent a lot of time before starting construction
looking at resorts in Thailand. I discovered people did not like to stay in
impersonal block hotels that could be practically anywhere in the world. They
preferred low-rise places that gave you a feeling for the country and area you
are in.â€™ At Bamboo Village, accommodation is in well-spaced-out bungalows
giving a rustic village feel and is made from Hawaiian classic bamboo with
thatched roof exteriors, not unlike some dwellings you may find in the nearby
countryside. Using these same principles, a second resort hotel is at the
planning stage at La Gi on the coast of the same province, but closer to Ho
Chi Minh City.  
â€˜Thenâ€™, she continued, â€˜I also noticed how universally people love
natureâ€™. The coconut trees around the swimming pools will give you the
ambiance of the Mekong Delta and the gardens with its copious tropical
greenery will make you feel you are in a rain forest. There is the wide golden
sand beach not far from your bungalow and of course the infinite azure expanse
of the ocean to add to your meditation. Be prepared for some mild encounters
with nature herself in the form of bird life, frogs, colourful lizards and
bats at night time. With sprays and netting, however, mosquitoes are kept well
at bay. Finally, for your spiritual relaxation, the resort spa specialises in
yoga.  
Next, I was anxious to learn Mrs Loanâ€™s philosophy on how to manage a hotel
successfully. â€˜I have learned a lot and apply a lot from my religion,
Buddhismâ€™, was the thrust of the reply. â€˜There is the â€œcircle of
happinessâ€ which we must keep turning. First I need to keep my staff happy.
We make sure all new staff are welcomed and assigned a mentor. We listen to
our staff and hold regular appraisals. There are no big hierarchical
differences and everyone works as a team. Once the staff is happy, this is
passed on to the guests. We listen to the guests and are always looking at
ways of improving performance and increasing guest satisfaction. We offer
value for money and provide a big breakfast buffet to cater for all
nationalities and tastes. In short â€˜Share, Care, Winâ€™ is our motto and the
win is for everyone.â€™  
This share-and-care policy extends beyond the confines of Bamboo Village into
the community of Binh Thuan province and the world beyond. She is an effective
fund raiser for worthy causes such as a heart operation for a Mui Ne villager,
a clean water supply project, or a construction of a bridge. She is also
active in helping children with congenital hearing conditions and works with
Buddhist monasteries in poor areas.  
The outreach extends even to co-operating with Catholic nuns who run houses
for homeless children in several provinces. â€˜They all call me Mum when I go
to visit.â€™ she says.  
Mrs Loan is active in the Tourist Association of Mui Ne, promoting both the
meaning of her hotel and the destination itself in exhibitions. She is upbeat
about the future of tourism in Vietnam. â€˜We still have many places to
develop. Look how long, for instance, our coastline is compared to that of
Thailand.â€™ says Mrs Loan.  
Mrs Loan reinforces the idea that you will only win if you listen to, co-
operate with and above all care for those around you, and not simply those
directly in your employ. In a troubled world where suffering and negativity
abound, it is heart-warming to be reminded that there are people who do care.
As I was coming away from the Bamboo Village office I was fully aware it was
not only the Vietnamese tea that had soothed me but also the spirit of the
woman herself.

The sweeping shoreline of Mui Ne was melting down under the blazing sun and
running away into the light blue seawater, just like gold would do in a
jewellerâ€™s casting machine. But it was suddenly cool in the shadow of giant
coconut trees in the Sunny Beach Resort & Spaâ€™s expansive grounds, bordering
the sandy shore. A few steps away, towards the beach area, the slimâ€“bodied
casuarina trees sprouted right from the sand and formed a thriving emerald
green canopy above long lines of resort sun loungers. Adding final touches to
the beauty of the moment were the soft notes of â€˜The Girl from Ipanemaâ€™
that flew from a restaurant deep in the resortâ€™s tropical garden, crossing
the infinity pool on their way and turning into a fanciful melody, with extra
notes added by the sea wind that conducted the tree tops like a maestro di
capella.  
The first and most impressive stand-out feature that strikes the eye from the
door of the Sunny Beach Resort & Spa reception area is the presence of the
verdant and flamboyant gardens that spread along several ha of the oceanfront.
The garden paths and labyrinth of stepping-stone walkways spread all over the
beautiful, lush green grounds and lead guests to the impressive variety of
luxurious four-star standard accommodations; beachfront ecoâ€“chic villas with
huge private terraces and open-air bathrooms hidden behind bamboo groves,
superior and deluxe three-story buildings painted in the warm colour of
champagne. The overall architectural style of Sunny Beach Resort & Spa
features noble-looking French colonial accents skilfully weaved with
Vietnamese rustic seaside village dÃ©cor elements, and gives both the relaxing
and refreshing feeling of being close to the limitless spaces of the Pacific,
and a bit of Eve & Adam in Eden feeling. Each tiny detail in the resort
architecture is meant to create a close-to-nature atmosphere or, rather, a
freeâ€“access to nature from luxurious rooms with every modern amenity.
Beautifully crafted clay pots with ladles made of coconut shell at the
entrance to the bungalows, rattan chairs on the balconies, dark wood floors
and antique-style decorative wooden ceiling joists in the rooms are those
well-thought-out finishing touches that add cozy local colour and flavour to
the stay at Sunny Beach Resort & Spa, and through them, the meticulous
attention to detail is clearly revealed.  
The stunning panoramic view from the deluxe room where I was booked was
bursting with bright colours gleaming and beaming, with all variety of shades
of blue and green under â€˜the border lightsâ€™ of the tropical sun at its
zenith. Down ahead of me were suntanned resort guests in some bright and
flying attire, strolling through the huge garden and looking like the
personages of Gauginâ€™s Tahitian paintings. The bodiless colibri were also
clearly seen on the canvas of some fanciful exotic painting that had all of a
sudden sprung to life on the Sunny Resort premises. Another absolute surprise
discovered and contemplated in utter amazement a bit later inside my Deluxe
room was a copy of a Paris street scene painting by Eduardo Cortes, striking
and instantly pulling one inside and behind the canvas into the chillingly
cool Rue Royale at dusk, in autumn, just after the rain. It was strange and
beautiful to find a picture of â€˜the Parisian Poet of paintingâ€™ in the
resort village of Mui Ne. To my further surprise, the means of soothing or
celebrating the deep art experience were all there at hand in the roomâ€™s
mini bar, represented with a choice of local and imported wines, long-stem
wine glasses and tire-bouchon provided with meticulous care. Meanwhile the
ceaseless breaking of the surf outside, some dozen steps down the stairs,
lured me to take a halfâ€“day long swim, eventually combined with relaxed
drifting along two resort infinity pools. As the day wore on, the Sunshine
Restaurant became animated with waiters preparing the scene for the poolside
Seafood BBQ feast with fresh tiger prawns, oysters and crabs galore in frills
of fresh vegetables already posing on the gastronomic catwalk formed by the
long lines of skilfully laid tables.  
Sunshine Restaurant is also where a full breakfast buffet is served. As I
discovered the next morning, the gastronomic palette featured a variety of
home-made pastries and tarts, as well as a hot station with traditional noodle
soup of the day prepared and served by a rose-cheeked and cheerful Russian
chef. (This colourful morning noodle serving show unfailingly gathering a
queue of admiring middle-aged females.)  
Resort Sun Spa, nestled in the very heart of the resort garden, offers the
full range of Asian massage and natural spa treatments.  
Primarily located on the beachfront in the very centre of Mui Ne resort
village, Sunny Beach Resort & Spa has everything the most discerning traveller
may need for an excellent seaside retreat, starting from vast green spaces and
direct access to the sea, and major sightseeing destinations to the small
details and pleasant (in-house) surprises that make oneâ€™s stay truly
memorable.

There are many deep rivers and abysses in the mountainous areas of Vietnam,
causing great difficulties for travellers, particularly during flood season.  
Simple suspension bridges made by local people, though gradually disappearing,
remain valuable to many in remote areas, particularly on Truong Son range and
in the Northern Central Highlands.  
The Xo Dang and Gie Trieng ethnic minority peoples in the areas are experts in
the building of suspension bridges.  
These bridges are usually made of rattan tied to large trees on either bank of
a river. Rattan is abundant in the mountainous areas in Vietnam. There are
suspension bridges made of rattan and tree branches that are as long as one
hundred metres. Usually, the main frame of a rattan suspension bridge is made
from two big rattans. Smaller ones and tree branches are used to weave them
into something like a hammock. Many of them have become a popular place for
villagers to gather to enjoy the shade of the trees and chat and play.

In 1867, after occupying the entire southern region of Vietnam, the French
colonists built many villas for their officials. Since then, French
architecture has influenced many Vietnamese wealthy landlordsâ€™ houses.
Nowadays, there are still many old houses with the combination of Eastern and
Western architectural style left in Mekong Delta, a locale once famous for
playboy landlords.  
The most well-known old house is at 255 A, Nguyen Hue Street, Ward 2, Sa Dec
Town, Dong Thap Province, though it is neither the oldest nor the biggest.  
Its fame is due to its being frequently mentioned in a best-selling semi-
autobiographical novel, which has been translated to 43 languages, has sold
2.4 million copies and was awarded the 1984 Prix Goncourt, a prestigious
French prize. It is â€œLâ€™Amanteâ€ (The Lover) written by the French writer
Marguerite Duras and was published in 1984 by Les Ã‰ditions de Minuit.  
The novel is about a love affair, which started â€œat first sight,â€ but
ended in resentful tears, between the owner of the house – a Chinese-
Vietnamese landlord named Huynh Thuy Le, 32, and the author, when she was 15.
The affair was said to be real and set in 1929 in Saigon and the Mekong Delta.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07477.jpg)  
Mr Huynh Thuy Le.

The house became more famous after the novel was adapted into a film under the
same name. Director Jacques Annaud included many erotic scenes, which are
reportedly so steamy that they were censored when the film was shown in
Vietnam.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07468-Nha-co-Huynh-Thuy-.jpg)  
Inside of the house of Mr Huynh Thuy Le.

In 2010, the government declared the house a â€˜national relicâ€™. According
to the information stated on the Dong Thap Province website, after the death
of Mr Huynh Thuy Le in 1972, his five children left to reside abroad and the
house was requisitioned as the police station of Sa Dec Town. In 2007, the
Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Dong Thap Province proposed that
the police station be moved to another place, so that they could open the
house to public and offer tours to visitors.  
While I was sipping tea and having ginger jam with other visitors, Ms Tuyen, a
tourist guide, told us that the house was built in 1885 by Mr Huynh Cam Thuan,
Leâ€™s father and a real estate magnate. At that time, the house, designed in
the Chinese â€“ Vietnamese architectural style, was made completely from rare
wood and has an area of 258 square metres. In 1917, Mr Thuan built a brick
coat in the French architectural style over the wood house.  
â€˜Mr Thuan was one of the richest men in Sa Dec Town, and his house was
renowned for being the biggest,â€™ Ms Tuyen said.  
â€˜The Vietnamese architecture is displayed outstandingly on the three-
compartment structure and the roof covered with yin-yang double tiles, while
the French architecture can be seen on the houseâ€™s faÃ§ade, floor and
ceiling, which are embossed with Renaissance-style patterns. In particular,
the domes above the doors, windows and gates are in the Roman architectural
style, which gives the house spacious and airy feeling. Furthermore, the
Chinese aspects can be recognized on the wardrobes, beds and altars, which are
carved and lacquered skilfully with dragons, birds and plants such as orchids,
champacas, chrysanthemums, bamboos and apricots to show the landlordâ€™s
wealth and superior rank.â€™  
Ms Tuyen added that since 2010, tens of thousands of foreigners have come to
visit the house every year, of which French visitors account for 50 per cent.
Many cultural researchers and architects also visit the house.  
Standing in the living room, Ms Tuyen pointed at the wall displaying photos of
Duras in her childhood and after completing the novel, and of Mr Leâ€™s
family: himself, his Chinese wife and children.  
â€˜Mr Huynh Thuy Le married a Chinese because Mr Thuan strongly disapproved
his sonâ€™s marriage with a â€œwhite girlâ€ and because Durasâ€™ mother and
her older brother refused to let her get married to a local man. As soon as he
married, Mr Huynh Thuy Le became the heir of the house.â€™  
The ceiling of the living room is carved with a big dragon encircled by four
bats holding coins in their mouths. Ms Tuyen said, â€˜These decorations
symbolize the affluence of the owner.â€™

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07487-Nha-co-Huynh-Thuy-.jpg)  
The altar honouring saint Guan Yu

Stepping to the front of the altar at the centre of the living room, which is
dense with encrusted and lacquered patterns, Ms Tuyen said, â€˜This is the
altar honouring saint Guan Yu (also named Guan Gong). According to the ancient
customs, the Chinese, especially businessmen, often worshipped this deity for
power and prosperity. Because the altar of Guan Yu is the soul of the house,
it is encrusted with ornate patterns which characterize the most typical of
Chinese culture.â€™  
Behind the living room are two wooden bedrooms carved elaborately with various
patterns. On the left side is the room for the boys of the family, whose door
was carved with images of urns, swords and books. On the right side was the
room for the girls of the family, which was identified by silk ribbons,
flowers and leaves. Nowadays, visitors can rent these rooms for a homestay
night at the price of VND900,000 for a room for two.â€™  
Scattered inside the house are tools and furniture, which are said have been
used by Mr Huynh Thuy Leâ€™s family, such as a safe, a make-up table, a wine
cabinet, and a bookshelf.  
_There is a one-night tour for VND800,000 â€“ VND1,000,000/person (depending
on the number of visitors). Price includes a visit to Sa Dec school – where
Marguerite Durasâ€™ mother worked as a principal, a visit to Kien An Cung
pagoda- which Huynh Thuy Leâ€™s father donated to about 100 years ago, a visit
to the flower village of Sa Dec – one of the biggest traditional flower
growing community in Vietnam and a sailing trip to discover Xeo Quit forest –
a national historic relic. Tel: +84 (67) 3773 937, or Email:_[

_**Photos: Sunrise Hoi An Beach Resort**_

While on a trip to Hoi An, I stayed in a place which was as enjoyable as my
destination. Please allow me to tell you about it.  
My odyssey took me to the Sunrise Hoi An Beach Resort. The staff helped me
feel right at home. The manager, Mr Jean-Luc Florent Bonneau, greeted me with
a cold glass of ginger tea and a warm French-style welcome.  
My suite was as large as a comfortable apartment and well-furnished with even
more amenities. It was a Sunrise Suite. The 16 Sunrise Suites feature an
expansive open-plan living area, hand-crafted to offer an abundance of
sophisticated space to relax and unwind. One can indulge in luxurious
pampering with double-wash basins, an opulent bathtub and separate rain shower
or seek repose in the luscious king bed, while enjoying the state of the art,
40-inch LCD television. A private terrace provides an enchanting setting to
admire magnificent views of the ocean or lush gardens or to indulge in a
romantic candlelit dinner with your loved one.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Suite---Sunrise-Suite-Livin.jpg)

Its size was not the only terrific thing about it. The amenities included a
well-stocked mini-bar, complimentary water, coffee and teas, as well as more
toiletries and indulgences than one could use in a week.  
In regard to dining, Mr Andre, a Dutch expatriate, and Ms Huong, do a great
job of managing the top-level restaurant. The staff is quite courteous and
helpful. They couldn’t do enough for me. When the breakfast buffet ran short
of maple syrup for my pancakes, the person in charge took care of it himself
and had it for me while my pancakes were still warm.

The staff did a great job of assisting me. When they discovered a problem with
my return ticket, they handled the problem immediately and made all
arrangements to correct it. I felt quite at ease with their assistance. The
day I left, they provided me with free transportation back to Da Nang Airport
for my return flight. They took an interest in me and did all they could to
help.  
Here one has all the comforts of home, as well as all the luxuries he could
ever desire. It’s a great place for a business convention, a vacation or

My ninety-year old father and younger brother came to Vietnam to visit for
just six days. They had requested a trip outside of Ho Chi Minh. Time being of
the essence, the easiest place for a quick getaway, I thought, would be Vung
Tau. The party consisted of we three, my wife and teenage daughter and a
friend and neighbour; six persons in all. I went ahead and booked a night at
the beach side Rex Hotel. I worked out a plan of action. In retrospect, it was
feasible but a little ambitious. â€˜Even the best laid plans of mice and men
can go awry,â€™ wrote Burns. Whilst I could have done better planning, Burns
never having been to Vietnam, could not have known this is a place where there
is hardly a dull moment. Things can never go wrong here; they merely take on a
different course.  
We chose to get there by hydrofoil. Not only is it quicker, but the scenery
would be much better, I thought, for our visitors and much more interesting
than taking the circuitous road route passing through endless drab suburbs and
with every chance of being stuck behind trucks for miles on end. I was aware
there have been issues of safety and breakdowns with these second-hand Russian
vessels, but we experienced comfortable rides. However, going out, the company
we had chosen to take us had to cancel and we were transferred to another but
with no change in schedule. Something needed to be done with the means of
boarding and disembarking. We were made to â€˜walk the plankâ€™ which is fine
if you are young and sprightly. Dad is nearing ninety and I had to take great
care of him. What would have been done with someone in a wheelchair?
Presumably the disabled are not catered to in this situation. The shipping
companies and the authorities need to ensure that proper metal boarding
bridges with hand rails are provided. On the way back, the aisles were blocked
with passenger luggage. â€˜There seems to be little regard for safety,â€™ Dad
remarked, â€˜what happens if we have to get off this boat in a hurry?â€™  
Otherwise, it was a great way to see the swamps and multifarious shipping,
from one-man fishing dugouts to huge ocean-going merchant vessels. This was a
very memorable river trip for my visitors. Graham, my brother, was amused by a
regulations notice which prohibits the carriage on board of dead bodies and
remains. Close inspection of the original Vietnamese revealed â€˜remainsâ€™
means funereal ashes. You have been warned!  
We docked at the front beach area. In my opinion, they have their beaches back
to front in Vung Tau. The front beach is a squalid affair. It is polluted by
all the boats that anchor in the harbour near it and the cloaca of an enormous
sewer is certainly off-putting. At high tide, there is hardly any beach at
all. The back beach, in contrast, is a lovely long silver strand facing open
ocean and stretching for kilometres. My brother walked the half a mile or so
to the hotel, mainly through a lovely park with a collection of stone
sculptures that included ones of fish and a mother and child. The rest of the
party went ahead by taxi to book us all in. The Rex is a good value-I would
say three star hotel. The Vietnamese food and service are of high standards.
It is a little worn in places, however, it does have one or two quirky points
about it. I personally like to swim at night, floating on my back, looking up
at the stars.  
When I tried to do this shortly after dusk, I was unceremoniously told it
closed at six oâ€™clock. When I went for my dip the following morning, there
was no life guard and I had to help myself to a towel. There was no concern
for safety whatsoever-do they think it is easier to drown after night fall?
The other odd thing was when we went to take a glass of wine on our room
balcony the telephone rang and we were told to shut the door. â€˜Either they
have spies or there is a sensor on the doorâ€™ thought I. Was the concern
about thieves rapelling down to our fourth floor room? More likely perhaps
they were worried about us letting in insects and then bothering them for
insecticide. Why not simply put a notice on the door?  
Anyhow, I had chosen the hotel as much for its location as anything else. I
had three objectives for this little escape and the hotel was well placed for
all three. It is only a few hundred metres from the cable car station to the
top of Big Mountain, which now has an entertainment complex to rival that of
the famous Genting Highlands in Malaysia. Then, it is only a short taxi drive
to the Temple of the Whale and the new International Armaments Museum (now
temporarily closed) on Small Mountain.  
After lunch, while the rest of the party rested up, my brother, daughter and I
headed off in a taxi for the Temple of the Whale. The driver we hailed was
from Hue and was clueless but had the gumption to call headquarters for
information and got us there. Over our two days in Vung Tau, we had no taxi
driver from Vung Tau and none of them knew the city. They came from Hue,
Hanoi, Danang and Soc Trang. I only know one place worse than Vung Tau for
taxi driver knowledge and that is New York.  
Our visit to The Temple of the Whale was only a partial success. It is housed
in a large compound with beautiful paintings of the story of the whale on the
walls. The Vietnamese venerate the whale as an incarnation of an emperor. The
â€˜Save the Whalesâ€™ campaign must be proud of Vietnam. Whale meat is one of
the few things that the Vietnamese on the whole do not eat. When one got
beached and died in Vung Tau, the locals hauled its carcass to this place and
built this temple in its honour. Unfortunately, the building in which it is
housed was firmly locked and all we could do is photograph the life-size
papier mache whale standing in front of it. A temple next door was open and it
had a lot of beautiful gilded statues in it. A friendly monk lets us wander
around and take pictures.  
The following morning, we attempted to visit the fairly recently opened
International Armaments Museum (now temporarily closed). The taxi driver, of
course, had never heard of it but it was easy to direct him to it, as it is in
an obvious location half way up the Small Mountain road. Unfortunately, it was
Monday and when we arrived, we found this is the one day of the week on which
it is closed. We were, however, able to appreciate the architecture. The
magnificent buildingâ€™s form matches its function. There are turrets and
crenallations and the front porch has a dome on which there is a painting
making it look like a mini Sistine Chapel. We also caught glimpses of gibbons
behind netting-the place doubles as a sanctuary for Vietnamese primates.  
Next we took a taxi to the cable car station. We had only a couple of hours,
but just enough time to enjoy the ride up and down, as well as the view and a
cup of tea at the top and maybe buy a souvenir or two. â€˜Can not do that, you
must have the package,â€™ we were told, â€˜which is ten dollars per head.â€™
No doubt if you are comimg for the day that represents great value for the
entertainment, but who ever heard of the â€˜packageâ€™ being the only ticket
you can buy?  
Not to be defeated, we hired a taxi to take us by road to the top.We started
to get our views on the winding mountain road. The taxi driver, of course,
being from Soc Trang, had never taken this road before and near the top, it
petered out into am impassable pot-holed track. Defeated once again, but at
least the taxi escaped undamaged. We retreated a few hundred meteres back down
and to our suprise we found a temple in the mountain woods. Given sanctuary
was a troupe of macaque monkeys. My father wound down the windows quickly and
shut himself firmly in. Two years previously he had been mugged by monkeys at
Can Gio and he was not going near simians again! My brother and I did get out
to pay a visit, climbing the stairway to photograph the statues representing
scenes from the life of the Bhuddha. The monkeys looked on curiously and a
couple of monks poked their heads out to shyly greet us.  
The trip was a success in that it satisfied my father and brotherâ€™s request
for a short trip to somewhere interesting outside of Saigon. They now know
that there are relaxing places beyond that frenetic city. Personally, I regard
Vung Tau as one of Vietnamâ€™s more aesthetic cities and I am glad we did not
quite get to see everything we had intended. It gives me a good excuse to
return and discover more on a future, less-hurried trip. Vung Tau will always
be there for those who need a little escape from lifeâ€™s stresses, just as
the French intended when they started the place as a seaside resort.

I sat under the beach umbrella with its thatched roof and drowsily
contemplated the sea. Its endless murmurings sounded like the chanting of a
group of monks, the waves turning over one another like the flicking of so
many prayer beads in a continuous orison to gods of restfulness. A deep calm
settled over me-or did it rise up from within in response to this earthly
paradise? Either way, I know for certain that the Swiss-Belhotel Golden Sand
Resort & Spa, near Hoi An, was responsible for the serene tranquillity that
pervaded my senses.  
The inside of the Swiss-bel is a study in tan and white, with airy wooden
pillars that gave the dining area a grand feeling without sacrificing the
sense of cosiness and intimacy.  
Upon my arrival, I was shown to my room, where a complimentary basket of
exotic fruits awaited, and I sank into more than one luscious piece of
produce, my mouth dripping with refreshing juices.  
My room was equipped with a safe deposit box, satellite TV, tea and coffee-
making facilities, mini bar, an attached bathroom and a hairdryer. These
amenities were but sublime icing on an already perfect cake; the atmosphere of
the place had already begun to cast its spell on me.  
Thus refreshed, I gambolled about the resort, noting exercise facilities, pool
tables, and tennis courts. There were mountain bikes for rent, a spa and
massage centre, and a kidsâ€™ area. What I wanted most was to sit next to the
water, and the resort happily fulfilled that desire. In short order, I was
ensconced in a hammock stretched between two stout palm trees whose broad
leaves danced in time to the relentless metronome of the waves.

The sun dipped low, embracing the horizon and then quenched itself in the East
Sea. The sky went from aquamarine to turquoise to midnight blue, and I headed
to my room, with its stunning view of the ocean. Walking along next to the
palm-tree lined pools, I saw the resortâ€™s multi-hued lights reflected in the
water, making a pastel rainbow kingdom where I imagined mere-folk might
frolic.  
The staff at the Swiss-bel is the stuff of customer service legend. Mr Coyle,
the manager, personally highlighted all the resort had to offer. But it was Ms
Anh who helped me fully appreciate the charms of the place. When she had
discovered that I had never before had a massage, she gladly performed her
relaxing magic on me. Her fingers bore such strength and dexterity, I
marvelled at how someone so diminutive could command so much power.  
Ms Anh also treated me to dinner at the on-site Italian restaurant. The
traditional pizza was a good as I had enjoyed in Italy. The chocolate mousse
was exquisite. When I was scraping the dish to salvage a little more of this
delicious treat, the server asked me, â€˜How about another?â€™ I was happy to
accept the offer.  
It was with much reluctance and a heavy heart that I said goodbye the next
day. I have decided that should I ever find myself in possession of a chest of
pirate gold, I shall at once sell it to live out the rest of my days trying to
understand the whispering of the waves at the Swiss-bel.

Beach resorts catering to mass tourism are a relatively new phenomenon in
Vietnam and I am happy to report that the mistakes that were made at such
brash places as Kuta Beach, Bali or Benidorm, Spain so far have not repeated
here. The main strip at that beautiful strand of sand called Mui Ne is
certainly busy and at times with all the Russian signage you can easily
imagine you are in the sunny Crimean, but nothing is overwhelming and the
skyline is low-rise. However, if you are looking for something more secluded,
recently some literally high-end places have sprung up hewn into the cliffs
before you reach this â€˜main dragâ€™. Passing by a few years ago, I viewed
this area as wasteland but human ingenuity is boundless. The pick of the small
bunch for me has the â€˜Poshanuâ€™ which only opened its doors a few months
ago.  
Turning off the road into an open courtyard and reception area, the theme of
the Poshanu Resort immediately becomes apparent. The building materials used
are brick and terracotta. A Cham tower looms above. This is a replica of one
of the Cham towers we passed by just a mile or so back. These are also called
Poshanu, after a girl in a tragic Cham love story. This hotel pays homage to
one of the worldâ€™s greatest civilisations that of Indianised Champa whose
last bastion was the Phan Thiet area. It managed to hold out here until 1836.
Also, here at the top area, there is a brick stupa type building which serves
as toilets. The architecture of the villas housing the rooms in which there
are friezes and pictures is also Cham influenced. Down at the swimming pool
area there is a brick colonnade with friezes of Cham musicians and asparas
(dancing girls).

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Bungalow-Seaview-1---Poshan.jpg)  
_Photo: Poshanu Resort  
_  
Now, as you are led to your room, you will be taken aback by the stunning
hanging gardens. I cannot compare, but Babylon surely could not have surpassed
this. A carpet of wild greenery bejewelled with dandelion and marigold sweeps
down the gently-sloping cliff pathway. There are flamboyant trees with their
flaming red flowers in bloom in the summer months. There is red and white
bougainvillea galore and swatches of white and yellow frangipani and jasmine.
Then there are palms and a tree bearing purple flowers whose name I do not
know. Of great economic importance to this province are also one or two dragon
fruit cacti which also bear a beautiful flower called â€˜Queen of the Nightâ€™
by some. Look out too for the rice terraces with frogs that croak loudly when
it rains and which are protected by a scarecrow as well as a vegetable garden.  
Our spacious octagonal room was housed in one of the villas. The ceiling was
raised in a tent-like structure. Here I noticed concern for safety sometimes
neglected in Vietnam in that there was a smoke detector. There was a four-
poster bed with netting, though we were not bothered by insects. There was
also a screen with a brass Cham portrait behind which was a grey stone washing
area and bathroom. The furnishings and fittings were of dark and cherry
hardwood and the flooring parquet. With all the greenery outside, there was
plenty of bird song. As I opened my eyes in the morning, I was even charmed by
the singing and sight of a bird on an uppermost branch near the window.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_0556.jpg)  
_Photo: Pip de Rouvray  
_  
In the afternoon, I stood out on the balcony to enjoy the sea view. There
below was the hotelâ€™s Champa restaurant and swimming pool. Beyond was a
private beach-no motorbikes streaking across the sand and no vendors- and a
jutting stone jetty formed a protective arm for a small port. My thoughts took
me not to the Cham but to a fishing village on the cliff-lined coast of county
Dorset, England. Specifically I felt I was back in the village of Lyme Regis
whose jetty was used in the film â€˜The French Lieutenantâ€™s Womanâ€™. I
almost saw my favourite actress Meryl Steep standing alone at the end of the
pier pining for her lover across the English Channel.  
There is fine dining in an atmospheric setting at Poshanu. The restaurant
itself, with its black columns, is like a traditional common house. We sat out
on the terrace at night with the breeze playing in palm trees and the
murmuring of waves hitting the shore. Out at sea was a long line of lights
from a fishing fleet that looked like a street at night. In the night sky, the
constellation of the Swan shone brightly. We had chosen a classic Vietnamese
set meal for three. For a family of three, this was exceptionally good value.
It was priced at VND180,000 per person with all taxes included. There were
spring rolls, strips of tender pork cooked in a clay pot and packed with
flavour, and a hot spicy soup featuring the delicious crab feeding cÃ¡ bá»›p
(Cobia). This all came accompanied by fluffy steamed rice and sautÃ©ed morning
glory in garlic. Coffee, tea and dessert came included-one of the ownerâ€™s
previous businesses was Italian style ice cream and among the exotic flavours
are mangosteen, durian and taro. Incidentally, when you check in, you are
presented with a coupon for a complimentary scoop.  
Breakfast, too, is a sumptuous affair with a wide range of choices both
Vietnamese and Western. I decided to test the quality of their ingredients.
When I asked to see what kind of olive oil they were using on the spaghetti, I
was shown a choice brand of Spanish extra virgin. The mustard I was brought
was no squeeze bottle supermarket one, but real Mc Coy French Dijon. My wife
remarked on the attention to hygiene and how clean the place is.  
A hotel like this can have everything you wish, but if the service is not up
to scratch you may be disappointed. Not so here; the staff is extremely
attentive. Not once did we carry our bags a single metre and when we were
leaving, the gardening staff downed tools, leaping to assist us.  
When the time did come to leave, my teenage daughter protested and asked to be
glued to a hotel chair. For the next few days her talk was nothing more than
â€˜I wish I was back thereâ€™. My rejuvenated wife said she no longer felt
tired as she does in Saigon with all the noise and motorbikes. The luxury
accommodation, the gardens, the glamour of Champa and the invigorating sea all
had combined to recharge the batteries of a family of three. When I play with
the word â€˜poshâ€™ in the title I refer only to luxury and not to any
connotations of pompousness. The Poshanu is a friendly resort which has which
has perfected the art of delivering relaxation for its guests!

Ha Giang is Vietnamâ€™s northernmost district, bordering China, with Lao Cai
to its west. It is famous for its rugged high mountains and spectacular
mountain passes, for the many ethnic minorities who live there, and for the
â€˜love marketâ€™ at Khau Vai, some 22 km from the town of Meo Vac. Unlike
Sapa and its surrounding villages in Lao Cai, well known to tourists, very few
western tourists visit Ha Giang, and the tourist infrastructure is under-
developed.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/h9.jpg)  
Ha Giang, June, 2013.  
_Photos: Bui Khuong Ha_

Ha Giang is sparsely inhabited, largely by people belonging to various ethnic
minority groups â€“ Muong, Tay, Lo Lo, Dao, etc. The mountains are straight
out of a â€˜Lord of the Ringsâ€™ film, with huge limestone pinnacles, 350-400
million years old, and fissured rocks that remind one of a lunar landscape.
The limestone is studded with a variety of fossil molluscs that show that
these mountains were once under water. It is geologically important, with
limestone/karst pinnacles and other formations, and a large heritage area
known as the Dong Van Karst Plateau Geopark has been established. It is
Vietnamâ€™s first Geopark and part of the UNESCO-supported Global Geoparks
Network (GNN). This Geopark occupies the four northeastern districts of Ha
Giang Province, i.e. Dong Van, Meo Vac, Yen Minh and Quan Ba, some 60 per cent
of which are covered by â€˜karstâ€™, which refers to a landscape sculpted by
erosion and characterized by irregular limestone pinnacles and rocks with
numerous caves, sinkholes, underground streams, etc. Apart from its value
geologically, it also has some important fauna and flora, and the scenery is
breathtaking. Together with the attractiveness of the ethnic minority groups
that live there, this makes it a very appealing tourist destination.  
Khau Vai commune, in Meo Vac district, is home to a number of different ethnic
minority groups. The â€˜love marketâ€™, which is also a cultural festival,
takes place there only once a year on the 26th and 27th days in the third
month in the lunar calendar. Many local people in ethnic dress participate and
thousands of Vietnamese tourists make the journey there, usually on
motorcycle. This year, an estimated 10,000 people attended. People buy and
sell local produce, ethnic jewellery, musical instruments, etc., as well as
food and drink for the visitors, and a there is a programme of cultural
performances – music/song, weaving, folk games, contests, etc. The market gets
its name from its legendary origins: there are various versions, but their
common theme is that the market provided an excuse for two lovers who were
unable to marry, for one reason or another, to meet annually and renew their
affection for each other. Others took their lead from this, and the market
provides an annual opportunity both to discreetly meet a former sweetheart and
for young people to meet each other. Apart from the â€˜love marketâ€™, the
towns in the area also have weekly markets which are well worth visiting.

Audience watching a performance at the Khau Vai Love Market

An important site for Vietnamese tourists, in particular, is the Flag Tower on
top of Dragon Mountain (Long Son) in Lung Cu commune near Dong Van, the very
northernmost part of Vietnam and very close to the border with China. The
tower and the Vietnamese flag that flies on top of it symbolise Vietnamâ€™s
now longstanding sovereignty and independence from its former ruler. For some,
a visit to the Lung Cu flag tower to see the Vietnamese flag fluttering in the
breeze is a patriotic act and an essential part of a visit to Ha Giang.

The beauty of the district and the interesting cultural traditions of the
ethnic people there should not allow one to forget that Ha Giang is also
Vietnamâ€™s poorest area, with low levels of income, education and health. The
villages are deep in the isolated valleys or, sometimes, high up the mountain
slopes, in terrain that requires back-breaking work. Much of the land is
hardly suitable for cultivation, yet the hardy people who live there manage to
create terraces on very steep slopes and to find small patches between the
jagged rocks to cultivate their crops. Their perpetual survival is a testament
to their indomitable spirits.

Bamboo Village Beach Resort & Spaâ€™s reception hall

Itâ€™s noon on a Saturday and from the throne of a huge bathtub that the
tropical sun paints in gold, I watch a dwarf bamboo grove nurtured skillfully
right on the tiled floor. Its regular-sized fronds shyly wave their finely-cut
foliage from behind a wide-open wood-framed window and through the sunroof I
discovered a few seconds ago by pulling a rope with a ring on the wall. A few
steps away, behind the transparent glass door, my deluxe room at the four-star
Bamboo Village resort on the stunning coast of Muine has, to my amazement,
turned into an improvised stage for a shadow puppet show. Abundant garden
greenery silhouettes dance as a sea breeze-the wire-puller in this production
blows and casts fanciful shades that fall on a spacious balcony with crossbars
made of lacquered tree branches, then on a giant queen-sized bed, work desk,
champagne-colored wooden wardrobe and expansive sofa set marking a separate
sitting area in the room. Watched within an airy and spacious room and
accompanied by the soft tunes of the sea waves and vibrant tropical garden
whispers, the scene provides a truly Zen moment. This last slips smoothly into
a shining botanical moment when one walks under the green dome of the
resortâ€™s expansive landscaped garden with ponds, lily pads and juicy green
lawns.  
But to start from the very beginning, (as any resort starts from the reception
area, just as any theater starts from coat checker to give the first lasting
impression), the Bamboo Village reception building impresses one from the
outside by its design, both exotic and intriguing, offering its guests not to
step in and check into a mere institution, but to embark a huge fishing boat
made of terracotta, reminding one of both a Vietnamese traditional fishing
sampan and Venetian gondola with pointed bow and stern. Embarkation made and
deluxe accommodation-skillfully hidden in away in several hectares of tropical
garden-taken, one is all ready for touring the expansive resort premises,
featuring thatched roof clay cottages with Deluxe and Superior rooms and
garden view and beachfront bungalows, all built along improvised small fishing
village streets marked with stone pathways with romantic and inspiring names
to set the right mood: Dove Cottage, Nova Deluxe, Queen and Prince room,
Hawaiian, Windy and Honeyed Bungalows and Water Lily Spa.

With a full range of modern 4-star comforts to please the most discerning
beach holiday makers, the resort offers a rich variety of accommodation, from
beachfront and garden bungalows-not just built, but literally woven and
handcrafted from baked sunshine-colored clay, bamboo trunks, stone and thatch-
to Cottages with Deluxe and Superior rooms, all together forming a picturesque
seaside village with chic gastronomy options of regular seafood BBQs by the
pool or private seafood dinners at the resort restaurant by the sea and state-
of-the-art facilities like a gym and spa center. Apart from sunbathing and
swimming in two pools and the Pacific ocean in totally relaxing eco-friendly
premises, The Bamboo Village offers its guests many other options and
remarkable moments; standing barefoot on the grass under the palm trees or on
the balcony under the thatched roof and watching the endless sparkling sea
only steps away, practicing tai chi in the early morning and yoga in the
afternoon with skillful instructors and attending cooking classes-all of which
can make them feel like â€˜blissful bamboo villagersâ€™.

The Water Lily spa will offer its guests long hours of relaxation and
indulgence with Bali, Thai, Chinese and traditional Vietnamese massage and
other complete spa packages.  
The resort has a lot of pleasant surprises to please and entertain each and
every guest; sports equipment for surf lovers and parasailers, varied tours to
sand dunes and ancient Cham towers for sightseers, a library for lazy holiday
fans and seafood culinary delights for epicures.

The very hands-on approach found in every detail at Bamboo Village, from eco-
chic style, warm and cozy interior designs, well-thought-out green solutions
for resort maintenance and the excellence of its staff performance, gives the
resort a very personal touch and thoroughly welcoming and intimate atmosphere,
pleasantly surprising to experience in a resort with a capacity of more than a
hundred rooms. Thanks to these outstanding features, Bamboo Village has justly
gained the title of being one of the top ten four-star hotels for 2010-2011,
awarded by the Vietnam Tourism Association and Vietnam National Administration
of Tourism.

Con Dao, April 2011.  
_Photo: Hoang The Nhiem  
_  
The Con Dao Archipelago, in Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province, in southwest Vietnam,
has 16 islands and islets, with a total area of 76 square kilometres. It was
listed as one of the worldâ€™s top ten romantic destinations in the world for
2011 by UKâ€™s Lonely Planet magazine.  
The pristine beauty of Con Dao was once a hell on earth, full of notorious
prisons, where many medieval punishments and tortures were carried out,
causing the deaths of about 20,000 prisoners.  
After three hours on a bus from Saigon, I arrived at Cat Lo Port in Vung Tau
City to buy a ticket for VND200,000, and then embarked on a ship full of
people and goods. The ship departed at 5 p.m., and after about one nautical
mile, hundreds of people got seasick, though the sea was quite calm with
gentle waves.  
At 5:30 the next morning, the ship docked at Ben Dam Port on Con Lon Island,
the biggest of Con Daoâ€™s islands. Hundreds of fishing boats were moored
alongside the pier.  
On the shore, many drivers of taxis, bikes and mini-buses were inviting
visitors to the center of Con Dao Town, which was 13 kilometres away. I chose
a motorbike driver at VND50,000.  
A room at an ordinary motel on Con Lon Island had a price ranging from
VND350,000 to VND400,000 per night. The electricity fee on the island was also
very high; about seven times more than on the mainland.  
I rented a room at VND1,790,000 per night at the three-star ATC Con Dao
Resort, which was close to the beach and just 200 metres from the oldest
prison. The resort had many isolated houses located on the campus of a large
garden, with an area of over 1.2 ha. It had the most trees among about 40
resorts, mini-hotels and motels in Con Dao.  
It seemed that all accommodations in Con Dao had motorbikes for rent, and the
prices ranged from VND100,000 to VND250,000 per day. There was only one
gasoline station on the islands.  
Except the labor camps scattered over the mountains on Con Dao, the other
relics related to the prisons were all located in a four square kilometre area
at the center of the town. All of the monuments in Con Dao have free entrance.  
The Governorâ€™s Residence, built in the late nineteenth century, was still
intact in the middle of a large garden shaded by big old trees. â€˜The total
area of the residence is 18,600 square metres. There have been 53 governors
living in this house,â€™ said a tour guide. Inside the quaint house, many
photos were displayed; prisoners tortured by the guards, prisonersâ€™ daily
activities, and prisonersâ€™ escapes and strikes. In addition, there were
hundreds of poetry books, story books and memoirs written by the prisoners and
about 200 inmate artifacts and torture tools used by the guards.  
At Phu Hai Prison, I saw that the gate, fences and all the structures inside
were undamaged, but covered with moss. A woman speaker said: â€˜Under the
French era, Phu Hai prison was originally called Bagne (Prison) 1, which was
built in 1863. It was the largest and oldest prison, including 10 collective
rooms, 20 cells, one chapel and a house for torture.â€™

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NHA-TU-5.jpg)  
Phu Hai Prison

About one kilometre from Phu Hai Prison was the area of tiger cages built in
1940. Most of the prisoners incarcerated in these tiger cages were senior
communists or agitators of uprisings or strikes for basic needs, such as water
and food in the prisons. The tiger cages were built by the French to apply the
most barbaric torture methods in secret; they were so well-hidden that it was
30 years before a US congressional delegation investigated the prison complex
and published the photos in the media.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NHA-TU-1---Chuong-Cop.jpg)  
A â€˜tiger cageâ€™ on Con Dao.

The tiger cages have two lines of cellblocks, which are about 30 metres long;
each cage is 1.5-metre by 2.5-metres, and held from four to five inmates. The
roofs were made of solid iron poles, so that the guards could both supervise
and torture the captives from the top down.  
The isolated detention zone of Chuong Bo (Cow Barn), about 1.5 kilometers from
the tiger cages, was built by the French in 1930 with nine cells, 24 pig
barns, two cow barns and an excrement cellar. Currently, only cells and the
excrement cellar were relatively unspoiled. â€˜It was called Chuong Bo because
badly wounded prisoners were often dropped down into the excrement cellar by
the guards,â€™ said the speaker.  
During the period of 1967 to 1969, when the Vietnam War escalated, the number
of prisoners reached a peak of 10,000 inmates. Many among them were future
leaders of Vietnam.

Currently, five ex-prisoners are still living in Con Dao. Former prisoner Phan
Hoang Oanh, 68, had been sentenced to 10 years in the penal colony and is
well-known for making a livelihood by running a cafÃ© inside the Governorâ€™s
Residence. He told me many brutal tortures that he had endured and witnessed.
He also said that there were now tens of ex-guards living in Con Dao. They
seem to have repented and live a peaceful and hard-working life, but they
avoid the press. While talking to me, he massaged his limbs and explained:
â€œWhen the weather changes like this, the wounds recur and my whole body
hurts.â€ Then, he pulled his pants and shirt up to show me the traces of
torture.

Tau Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism._

According to â€˜A Sketch about Con Dao Relic Complex and its Legendsâ€™
published by the Relic Management Board of Con Dao in 2012, said â€˜The French
colonials started the construction of Con Dao prisons in 1862. In March, 1862,
fifty prisoners were exiled to Con Dao. Then, the French forced prisoners to
break rocks and calcinate limestone to build detention centers. In September
1954, the French withdrew from Vietnam; the US-backed South Vietnamese
government took over the prisons and built new incarceration camps. By April,
1975 when the Vietnam War ended, Con Dao had a total of 127 prisons, 44 cells,
504 â€œtiger cagesâ€ (special solid cells for dangerous prisoners, with an
area of only about three to four square meters, holding four to five
prisoners) and 18 brutal labor camps featuring punishments such as smashing
stones, dragging trees, baking bricks, calcinating limestone and making
salt.â€™  
 **Getting there:** Vietnam Airlines has three departures daily from Tan Son
Nhat airport in Saigon to Con Dao. A ship departs daily at 5 p.m. at Cat Lo
Port in Vung Tau city to Con Dao Islands; the ticket fee ranges from VND85,000
to VND200,000/ ticket. Peak tourist season is March to September, so a two-
week advance booking is recommended.

_  
As an elderly porter, big and broad, with anchor tattoos on his forearms
guided me through a verdant tropical garden with such determination as if he
was steering a ship at rough seas rather then carrying my baggage to the
Seaview Deluxe room at Allezboo resort in Muine where I had just checked in.
Intensified by the blazing sun at its zenith and a sea wind blowing in my
face, the mirage became so vivid that I nearly believed we were heading, to
say the least, to a wind-blown and storm-beaten whaler berthed some twenty
steps distant on sparkling waters at the sandy beach, all ready for sail-away.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/walkway1-%5B%5D.jpg)

I entered the elegant snowy-white colonial building of the Allezboo resort
reception area, with a huge garden right behind it picturesquely framed by two
deluxe accommodation buildings with thatched roofs flaring in the breeze, were
none other then a gateway to the filibusterâ€™s embarcadero. It was skilfully
hidden behind palm trees with frills of ripe coconuts, magnolia trees in full
bloom and wide branching gletisias with dark curls of pods. In spite of the
sudden skid of imagination, the porter and I ended up entering a spacious
Deluxe room full of natural light, with noble-looking dark wood furnishing.
The retired sea dog (salt seaman) gallantly swung the balcony door wide open,
letting the fresh and salty sea breeze in and took his leave. The sweeping
vistas of the limitless sea till the very horizon with flying bright spots of
kites, multicoloured sails of windsurfers gliding on its giant canvas and
stunning sandy coastline stretching away for long kilometres to the left,
contemplated from the balcony, took the breath away. Far below on the right,
in the shadow of tropical greenery, sparkling in the sun and irresistibly
tempting, lay the resort infinity swimming pool with huge Jacuzzi bath. The
splendid Jacuzzi, observed yet from afar, looked extremely promising for a
Jacuzzi party with champagne in the best traditions of decadence. The room
interior dÃ©cor, combining harmoniously the subtle elegance of French colonial
style and truly Vietnamese antique-style furniture, lamps and accessories,
impressed me by its creative and well-though-out approach. Later, when I
walked back to the reception to meet the front desk manager to show me
Allezboo’s resort premises I was (pleasantly) surprised to discover a
creatively different, non-trivial and harmonious combination of East and West
in architecture, starting from overall architectural style and down to even
the small details. On entering the reception lobby, with its French-style
wooden furniture and looking around closely, I discovered a big Vietnamese
throne-like ancestral altar occupying the entire second floor, facing the
garden and overlooking the sea through the spectacular Vietnamese-style arc,
which in its turn, looked straight into the swimming pool and finally in the
vast spaces of Pacific ocean, so that the cool wind from the sea breezed
through the whole resort area.  
The first line of the resort ocean front was given to two sumptuous honeymoon
pool & Jacuzzi villas with a spacious living room occupying the ground floor,
2 full baths overlooking the sea, private Jacuzzi and bedroom with luxurious
antique furniture on the first floor, and a private swimming pool with sun
loungers under the shadow of a generous piece of tropical garden.

The beach front from the other side was where I found the Spicy Lobster
Restaurant, with its sophisticated exterior and interior dÃ©cor featuring
fanciful antique candleholders, tinted green and blue from the time and sea
salt, looking exactly the same as one could imagine to find at a pirateâ€™s
treasure chest or at the old castles in France or Spain. The walls were
decorated with an amazing collection of black and white pictures of the people
of Vietnam’s faces, full of life and expression. Each and every detail in the
restaurant interior dÃ©cor aims to provide a warm and restful environment to
the guests. The Spicy Lobster restaurant offers nightly fine dining, as well
as a la carte menu, Western and Vietnamese cuisine and an extensive wine list.
Itâ€™s also where breakfast in the full buffet variety is served. The culinary
breakfast palette includes a hot station with Vietnamese traditional noodle
soups changing everyday and big choice of baked tarts and cakes.  
A lotus spa placed within an ancient Vietnamese wooden house hidden in the
deep of the garden, and invites one to indulge oneâ€™s precious self in
natural spa treatments and sauna.  
With a step out on a beach, one can contemplate the long line of sandy coast
stretching for more then 15 km to the north. It is meant for hours-long
sunrise or sunset barefoot strolls or lazy watching of bronzed beach walkers
passing by. Muine and its surroundings have plenty of sites and sport
activities to offer for active travellers, from kiting and windsurfing to
exploring sand dunes and canyons, ancient cham towers and wilder landscapes
laying south of Phan Thiet yet off the beaten track.  
Allezboo resort offers an exquisite accommodation built, planned and decorated
with perfect taste and creativity, where style and nature meld perfectly
together on the prime oceanfront setting.

11/20/2019,Seeing the light and experiencing the dark of Cu Chi Tunnels,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/seeing-the-light-and-experiencing-the-dark-of-cu-chi-tunnels/,,By Tran Nguyen Anh,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/ben-mieng-ham-ca-nhan-2-by-.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/000000034.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_0811-Cu-Chi-By-Nguyen-V.jpg,"_(No.3, Vol.3, Apr 2013 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

In Cu Chi, during the lunar New Year in February, Quoc, a tour guide, led two
dozen Japanese tourists into a tunnel. They were middle-aged and had heard a
lot about the Vietnam War.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/ben-mieng-ham-ca-nhan-2-by-.jpg)  
Staff member of Cu Chi Tunnels Relic Area. _Photo: Tran Nguyen Anh_

They chose Vietnam as their vacation spot for the lunar New Year. Each of them
had a camera, took photos incessantly, and constantly asked the tour guide
questions. Quoc said, â€˜we bring the tourists down here non-stop for a day
during the New Year Festival.â€™  
The network of Cu Chi tunnels, 60km Northwest of Saigon, started in 1946 as
Vietnamese fought against French and was expanded in the early 1960s by
Vietnamese Communists to fight against the US-backed Saigon forces during the
Vietnam War in the 20th century. It is now one of the worldâ€™s top ten
underground walks, as selected by National Geographic Magazine.  
From the outside, few would suspect that a network of intertwined tunnels with
a total length of 200km lies beneath their feet.  
Quoc said, â€˜The tourists are curious and ask to see where the air holes
are.â€™ Quoc led them to a termite mound, where there was an air hole as small
as a crab burrow.  
A group of young American tourists squeezed down a tunnel to take pictures.
They joyfully shouted, â€˜Take a picture! Take a picture!â€™ Someone said,
â€˜good luck!â€™ The door of the tunnel banged shut. Tree leaves veiled it
discreetly. A moment later, an American lad popped up. Panting but enthused,
he announced, â€˜Itâ€™s so dark!â€™  
The individual tunnel is just enough to allow one person to slip through with
a gun.  
Foreign tourists often ask, â€˜Living like that in the secret tunnels,
whereâ€™s the restroom?â€™ The restrooms are also a secret. Tourists spoke to
one another about an American veteran, who said that they once laid in ambush
along the river when the tides were rising. They thought that the Viet Cong
would leave the tunnels to relieve themselves. However, it was the American
soldiers who were ambushed and had to retreat.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/000000034.jpg)

The harsh life in the Cu Chi tunnels draws more attention than do grand
structures. According to Van Hoa Newspaper of 9 March, 2011, the Independence
Palace which was the office of the president of the US-backed South regime
government, received, in 2010, close to 780,000 visitors, whereas the number
of visitors who visited the Cu Chi tunnels has at least 1.26 million.  
The group of Japanese tourists gathered round to squeeze into a section of an
underground tunnel that was over twenty meters long. Some people in the
American tour group turned back, daring only to tread above ground. An
American youth told me that he was afraid of getting stuck because the tunnel
was too narrow for him. Another feared that he would get lost underground!  
Tourists stood next to the entrance of a tunnel to look at photographs that
were taken inside the dark tunnels. Taking pictures inside the Cu Chi tunnels
is not easy; the tunnels are narrow, tortuous, and quite humid. Many digital
cameras take pictures that come out indistinct, so it is impossible to shoot
photographs.  
Two female Taiwanese tourists demonstrated their strength by lifting the gun
barrel of a broken tank. â€˜We succeeded!â€™ they ebulliently exclaimed.  
Gun blasts still resound daily at Cu Chi, from the shooting range reserved for
tourists. Each bullet is sold for VND40,000 ($1.90). One clip has 10 bullets.
Tourists only shoot for a few minutes before they run out of bullets â€” such
is the dissipation of war. â€˜I learned to be a soldier at Cu Chi by shooting
an AK-47,â€™ conveyed a tourist.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_0811-Cu-Chi-By-Nguyen-V.jpg)

Van Tuan.  
_  
Mr So, an employee at the bullet kiosk, said that every day, several hundred
tourists fire guns. They prefer shooting the M-16 submachine gun, since it
looks nice.  
â€˜There are tourists who fire up to 50 bullets before quitting,â€™ Mr So
said, â€˜Itâ€™s been several decades, but the guns still work consistently
without misfiring.â€™ Mr Soâ€™s older brother died from a cannon round when he
left the tunnels to join a meeting. â€˜Quite a number of people were struck by
cannon fire that day,â€™ Mr So confided in me.  
Having squeezed into the tunnels, scaled hilled, and fired guns, the group of
American tourists stopped at a canteen tent. A free meal is offered, evoking
memories in some of the military canteens that served for a time along the
roads of military operations where mothers who, without concern for bullets
and bombs, saw off their sons when they went off to war, uncertain of the day
in which they would return.  
On worn-out wooden tables were boiled cassava dipped in salt and sesame. Tea
was poured into old cups. The tourists ate the cassava with their compliments.
They hunger was dispelled by the characteristic food of Cu Chiâ€™s parched
hills.

**The holes that helped win the war  
**  
â€˜Cu Chi was the most bombed, shelled, gassed, defoliated and generally
devastated area in the history of warfare,â€™ wrote authors Tom Mangold and
John Penycate.  
The 40 square miles known as the â€˜Iron Triangleâ€™, Northwest of Saigon,
served as a stronghold of the Vietnamese Communists throughout the Vietnam
War. It was of strategic significance, because it straddled the main land and
the river routes used by the Vietnamese Communists to smuggle supplies into
South Vietnam from the terminus of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Cambodia,
according to â€˜The Tunnels of Cu Chi,â€™ by Ramon W. Almodovar, and J.David
Rogers. This was also the only sizable area in South Vietnam where troops and
vehicles could move easily during the monsoon season (May to October).  
According to â€˜Cu Chi Tunnels,â€™ (Ho Si Thanh, 2002, Social Science
Publisher,) there were subdivisions of tunnel with mouths accessing the Saigon
River. These mouths allowed people to secretly cross the river to Binh Duong
Province. The tunnels were resistant to cannon shells and the heavy weight of
tanks and armoured cars. Some deep sections were capable of protection even
against small-scale bombs. There were sections two to three storeys deep, and
the lower (â€˜submergedâ€™), equipped with lids over covert openings leading
to tunnels that connected the storeys. There were also block-points at
sensitive spots to obstruct an enemy or to stop toxic chemicals. Numerous
mouths were designed to serve as fighting nests, which utterly surprised the
enemy. There were reserves of weapons, food and water, smoke-tight kitchens,
meeting rooms for leaders and commanders, dispensary facilities for surgery,
living quarters for wounded and convalescing combatants, and quarters for
women, old people and children.  
US air attacks, artillery, napalm and Agent Orange defoliant turned the land
into a moonscape.  
The Americans also used water to inundate the tunnels, bulldozers to unearth
them and dogs to sniff out hidden Vietnamese Communist guerillas.  
Soldiers of narrow build, specially trained, and known as â€˜tunnel ratsâ€™
crawled into the tunnels with a flashlight and a short gun to clear tunnels
and destroy them with explosives.  
Also, a special type of grass was dropped on Cu Chi. It grew very quickly,
killing other kinds of foliage as they expanded their zone. It was very sharp,
making it difficult for Communist forces to move and easier for US forces to
detect them, according to â€˜Cu Chi Tunnelsâ€™ by Ho Si Thanh. When dry season
came, the grass, known as â€˜American grass,â€™ became dry and easy to set on
fire.  
In 1966, 8,000 US and Australian troops attempted to sweep Cu Chi in what was
called Operation Crimp, according to â€˜The Tunnels of Cu Chi,â€™ (Almodovar
and Rogers). A year later 30,000 US troops raided Cu Chi again in Operation
Cedar Falls.  
The tunnels stood firm and were used by Vietnamese Communists to prepare for
their Tet Offensive attack on Saigon in 1968.

Itâ€™s tiring to climb up the top of Small Mountain (NÃºi Nhá») but once
youâ€™re there, you can not only see the largest statue of Jesus Christ in
Asia but also the giant cannons and a panoramic view of this city. Thatâ€™s
worth the sweat, isnâ€™t it?â€™ the owner of the hotel where I stayed in Vung
Tau said when seeing that I was hesitant to hike up to the top of the
mountain. Vung Tau city is 125 km northeast of Saigon.  
Leaving the centre of Vung Tau city and following Halong Street on the coast
line about two kilometres, I reached the foot of Small Mountain. Hiking on the
stone steps sandwiched by two lines of frangipani trees booming with white
flowers, I saw statues, placed every 100 metres, depicting classic scenes from
the Bible of Christianity. The 4-metre-wide path is very steep. Walking about
200 metres more, I encountered a dome filled with many benches inside for
visitors to rest.  
After 20 minutes of hiking and enjoying the immense blue sky above and the
deep blue sea below, I had conquered a kilometre of winding stairs, which put
me 170 metres above sea level. The top of Small Mountain is fairly flat with
an area of 1.2 ha covered with hundreds of stone benches beneath old trees,
which are bare due to the sunlight of the dry season. At the centre of these
benches is the lofty statue of Jesus Christ standing in an upright position
with arms outstretched above two massive old cannons, which have been
recognized as â€˜national historic relicsâ€™ by the government. Adjacent to
the statue is a beverage counter.

the statue construction began in 1974 and completed in 1994.  
In 2011, the chief priest of Vung Tau city, Tran Van Huyen, told the Todayâ€™s
Knowledge magazine that â€˜The statue is 25 metres in height and it pedestal
is seven metres high.â€™  
In 2012, the Asia Book of Records recognized it as the largest statue of Jesus
Christ in Asia.  
The pedestal of the statue is a rectangular platform whose four walls are
carved with four large bas-reliefs illustrating classic references to Jesus
Christ.  
Inside, the hollow statue has an area of about 50 square metres used to
display more than 50 oil paintings describing the activities of Jesus and many
photos telling about the statueâ€™s construction.  
Following the spiral staircase around the heart of the statue, I climbed up to
its shoulders. From there, I poked my head out to have a panoramic view of
Vung Tau city.  
At the sides of the statue are two cannons in two concrete block houses, which
look like two four-ton elephants kneeling with their long trunks trumpeting
the sea.

According to the above-mentioned document, there are 15 cannons arranged at
different heights on Small Mountain. On nearby Big Mountain, there is an
artillery array of six cannons with 240mm calibre, located at an altitude of
100 metres above sea level. They were installed in 1885 by the French.  
There is a notice board at the gate at the beginning of the path to the Small

Arriving in Hue after having traversed Cambodia and Southern Laos and then
crossing over the Annamite (Truong Son) Range, it seemed appropriate to stay
at a hotel called the Indochine Palace. The â€˜palaceâ€™ bit was particularly
attractive, as I had spent the two previous nights in windowless guest house
rooms. From the outside, there is little to earn this epithet. It is a
seventeen-storey tower block distinguished only by a grey slate-looking French
roof with gables. One might imagine the chief merit of this hotel might be its
location on the road to the airport next to the Cao Dai temple and a large
supermarket in the central business area and only a stoneâ€™s throw from the
Perfume River and the Citadel.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_0231.jpg)  
Lamp at Palace Suite

But make no mistake, once through its portals, the sumptuousness of this place
hits you like lightning. Neo-classical columns greet you head on, above are
chandeliers and on the high walls of two sides there are murals of aristocrats
costumed in the manner of the Imperial Hue court that must have cost a pretty
penny. The owner has dedicated her hotel to the memory of Vietnamâ€™s last
Queen, Nam Phuong and many of the paintings and friezes adorning the walls
throughout the property show scenes that might include her. For instance, in
the main dining hall there are pictures of demure young ladies taking tea and
practicing traditional musical instruments. It was Tet when I visited and a
further Vietnamese flavour was added by the yellow flowers of apricot Tet
trees on every floor, as well as kumquat trees bearing fruit.  
Equally, there is a French Indochine feel to this place. Inside, you would
never guess this building is a mere four years old. All the floors take you
back to the eighteenth century, with beautifully waxed commodes and ornate
gilded wall mirrors. Even the windows in the rooms do not have curtains, but
pull down shutters and slatted wooden doors. French elegance is â€˜partoutâ€™!  
As you might expect of a building this size, there are views to be enjoyed. As
you take the panoramic lift to your room, you look down not only on the lobby
and pool, but also vast areas of Hue. From the higher levels, there are
glimpses of the river. Seated out on the balcony of my room, I had more
leisurely vistas of Southern Hue stretching away to verdant paddy fields and a
mountain backdrop.  
At the back of the hotel, the scenes transport you to a faraway, long-gone
palace -that of the sybaritic Villa Adriana of Tivoli, the ancient Romansâ€™
retreat. Behind the Olympic size swimming pool there is a double row of
classical colonnades and tall palm trees flank the sides. The gardens are
extensive and in use for weddings and special events. Further features
straight out of the Tivoli blueprint are a pergola walk and a rotunda under
which to sit and chat. There is room here for lawn games; a concept which
might take a little selling to the Vietnamese. The aristocratic game of
croquet would not be out of place here. At the back of my mind, I have long
thought of spreading to the world a game which is a forerunner of cricket and
presently only seen in Eastern parts of the English county of Kent. Itâ€™s
called â€˜Bat and Trapâ€™ and can be played in any small grassy area. I
discussed the matter with the General Manager Mr Patrick Fernandez, a relaxed
and smiling gentleman, but one with an ever-present eye for detail. He said he
had considered a putting green.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_0235.jpg)  
Living room in Palace Suite

Also among these swards, there is a pet project of the owner or the on-going
construction of a model European village. At present, there are twenty houses,
a farm and a park with plenty of figurines. I walked along the winding
roadway, looking down at the pretty scenes and feeling like Gulliver in
Lilliput. This kind of thing, I felt, would appeal to Asian guests such as the
Chinese and Japanese.  
My visit coincided with Valentineâ€™s Day, and my wife and daughter and I
enjoyed the International Buffet laid on for the occasion in the main
restaurant, called La Brasserie. The place was packed. I was just about the
only European face there. Some of the diners were Taiwanese tourists, but the
majority were young local couples. Ironic, I thought, as back where I come
from the day passes by hardly celebrated. It did give rise to a jest from our
thirteen year old daughter – â€˜all these girls here with their boyfriends and
I get lumbered with parents!â€™ â€˜A few years time and she wonâ€™t be
joking,â€™ I thought to myself. Anyhow, the food could not have been better.
Not only smoked salmon, sushi and lumpfish caviar, but roast beef and loads of
Asian fare, as well as one Middle Eastern and Mexican dish each. My Hue wife
gave it 9.5 out of 10, which, as I explained to G.M. Patrick is, if only the
world knew it, equivalent to two Michelin stars. (I dropped the half point, by
the way, only because my wife would have liked a few more Vietnamese dishes.)
The buffets cost a reasonable VND360,000 inclusive of all taxes and live
entertainment by a solo violinist and male singer of modern Vietnamese songs.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_0250.jpg)

I have mentioned the room before. I stayed in a Deluxe King Room. It is the
kind of room so luxurious that you could easily sleep contentedly in the
bathroom (and wash basin area) which is separated from the bed/living room
part by a dark wood oriental screen. I sat down in the evening in a
comfortable armchair with feet up on a pouffe and enjoyed watching a good film
on the large flat screen T.V. while sipping away on a Huda (Hue-Denmark) beer.
It is a mark of attention to detail of this hotel that the beer mat provided
is used is custom-made for the hotel with an ancient Hue scene depicted on it.  
A mention has to be made of the excellent fitness room, the sauna and steam
bath, the wide array of â€˜spaâ€™ treatments on offer and a full size pool
table. The kids are not neglected either, with a special room for them.  
Finally, they have done a good job on training, as the service also meets the
five-star mark. All the staff members I met were most attentive. Whilst some
work could have been done with some work on final consonants, as difficult for
the Vietnamese as tones are for Europeans, I had no problems communicating in
English. Also, (and this is only a minor irritation), while it is nice for
staff to address you by name, even here reception had not yet got it that
â€œMrâ€ goes with the surname. Still, it is quaint to be addressed as Mr
Philip.  
I have stayed in a few top-end places in Hue and two of them are genuinely
historic. All of them were great but I have to say, even though this is an
advertorial, if you are affluent or have money for a splurge and looking for
the last word in palatial luxury this has to be it. The Indochine Palace Hotel
Hue has been a carefully well-thought out project and in just a few years has
established itself as one of the leading hostelries not only in Hue, but in my
humble opinion, probably the whole of Vietnam.

_

Even if you look upon a hotel just as a place to put your head down for the
night, you are still going to spend at least a third of your time in your room
and it is important you feel comfortable in it. At the five-star level, you
can expect your room not to look tired, but energetically young. Refurbishment
is an opportunity for a hotel to review its philosophy and respond to the
expectations of its guests more accurately. I sat down over a Vietnamese
coffee at the ground- floor Boudoir Lounge to listen to M. Betrand Courtois,
General Manager, explain the brief given to renowned interior designer M.
Maciag. I learned was the main idea was to incorporate French elegance with
Vietnamese features. This is not a bland modern hotel catering solely for
those who want a room that feels like home, but one that wishes to imbue the
flavours of the country that the guest may have traversed half the globe to
visit.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Luxury-Room-Interior_SSP.jpg)

M. Courtois then led me on a tour to see four types of room in their newly
acquired finery: superior, luxury, club floor luxury, and suite. The
philosophy at work here is that your room begins as soon as you step out of
the lift. The rooms are adorned with black and white photographs of idyllic
and typical Vietnamese scenes and there are highly polished chests of drawers
in the eighteenth century French style. One such commode on the club floor
really does combine notions of the two countriesâ€™ culture. It contains a
collection of Vietnamese calligraphy brushes under glass. Finally, all the
doors have a gilded bamboo bird cage on them to let you know you are coming
home to roost.  
Starting on the seventh floor, the walls in the superior and luxury rooms are
painted grey purple and deep pink, having a very warm and feminine feel. The
oriental lacquering on the lampshades lets you know you are now in Vietnam.
From the superior room, there was a great view of the city with washed walls
and orange tiled roofs. At ground level, you never notice that HCMC can be
Mediterranean or even Moroccan in looks. The luxury room had modern grey
furniture, but with the curves of bygone French design. An ebony black slatted
wooden easy chair married in a Vietnamese note to the ambience. The view from
here was of rather boring skyscrapers, but with a stretch of the river
visible. (Not the fault of the hotel, but I could not but think that the
traditional oriental regard for harmony â€“ feng shui (Vietnamese â€˜Phong
Thuyâ€™) seems almost literally to have gone out of the window these days.  
The Club floor luxury room I saw continued the main theme, but with a little
more spaciousness. Here the walls were painted grey and orange. The white mini
fridge was in the form of one of those baskets in which you see people in the
streets steaming buns or which are used in Cantonese restaurants to serve dim
sum. We took a look at the shower area. Embossed on the glass doors were the
first words of La Fontaineâ€™s version of the Aesop fable â€˜The Tortoise and
the Hareâ€™ â€“ â€˜Rien ne sert de courirâ€™, or â€˜No Need to Rushâ€™. M.
Coutois then pulled open a wardrobe to draw my attention to its backing as he
explained â€˜Tuile de Jouyâ€™. This is a cloth canvass panting upon which is
painted a French pastoral scene of the eighteenth century â€“ another very
nice touch!  
Then it was on to uppermost level to view the suite which contained all the
features hitherto mentioned, but in, of course, apartment-sized dimensions. At
the end of the vestibule cum living room area on a brightly waxed table there
awaited a bottle of Champagne in its bucket and on ice as well as a carafe of
orange juice. â€˜These would not be included in the price of the room,â€™ said
Betrand. The bathroom here was the about the size of a normal hotel room. It
was encased in uncurtained glass windows and looked so fine that I felt I
would have been happy enough to sleep in it.  
We returned to the Boudoir lounge for a fruit cocktail and chat. M. Courtois
spoke to me of the countries he has worked in â€“ in particular England and
China. But it seemed clear to me that Vietnam is the one for which he has the
softest spot. He has worked before in this country and this hotel, but not as
G.M. It pleases him to see the rooms under his charge now refurbished in a
style that harmoniously fuses both his native landâ€™s culture with that of
Vietnam. I hope you too may be lucky enough to get a taste and feel of these
rooms. You may even like their vibrancy of your room so much that you might
feel it difficult to step out of it.

_  
Travelling around Long Son Island, I saw many men with long hair tied up in
buns and wearing traditional southern Vietnamese clothing, like people did one
hundred years ago.  
Phd Dinh Van Hanh of Vietnam Institue of Culture and Arts, Ho Chi Minh branch,
says that there are few places where people still maintain as many of the old
traits of southern culture as in Long Son. The island is in Ba Ria-Vung Tau
Province, about 80 km to the northeast of Ho Chi Minh City.  
Long Son Island has an area of 92 square kilometres and a population of 13,558
people, of which 65 to 70 percent are followers of Ong Tran religion (Ä‘áº¡o
Ã´ng Tráº§n), Mr Vo Van Mui, the chairman of the Peopleâ€™s Committee of Long
Son Commune said.  
According to the Tourism Newsletter of Ba Ria Vung Tau Department of Culture,
Sports and Tourism, published in the fourth quarter of 2012, the founder of
Ong Tran religion was Le Van Muu, who was born in 1855, in Kien Giang, a
province in the southwest region of Vietnam. He followed the Tá»© Ã‚n Hiáº¿u
NghÄ©a (Four Debts of Gratitude) religion and participated in the French
resistance. In 1900, to escape from the French pursuit, he and his 20
relatives sailed to Vung Tau, choosing Long Son Island, still uninhabited at
the time, to settle. He and his men grew rice and harvested salt for living.
He founded a religion based on the philosophy of Tá»© Ã‚n Hiáº¿u NghÄ©a.  
Tá»© Ã‚n Hiáº¿u NghÄ©a was established by Ngo Loi in May, 1867, in An Giang
Province; though being a Buddhist sect, its philosophy is the mixture of the
teachings of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and the ancestor worshipping
customs of Vietnamese people.  
â€˜Mr Muu was often without any shirt on during the day, so the people called
him â€œMr Tranâ€ (meaning Mr Upper Half-Naked) and he founded Mr Tranâ€™s
religion. With the philosophy that: â€œIf you are a human being, your head
must touch the sky, your feet must stamp on the ground,â€ he advised his
followers to wear bÃ ba Ä‘en, the southern traditional black clothes, walk
barefoot and wear their long hair in buns without any hats on their heads,â€™
said Hai Teo – a follower of Mr Tranâ€™s religion.  
He told the believers to worship God, fairies, Buddha, and saints; at the same
time, he wrote poetry and read story books with themes of human decency to
teach them about benevolence, propriety, loyalty, intellect, trustworthiness
and filial piety.  
His religion advocates no pagoda building, no prayer chanting, and no fasting
or forcing followers to be vegetarians or to renounce family and dissolve
love.  
With such a â€˜philosophyâ€™ on eating, clothing and religious practices, the
inhabitants on Long Son Island said that Mr Tranâ€™s religion is simply an
approach to being good people.  
Documents from the Peopleâ€™s Committee of Long Son Commune show that Mr Tran
also created distinctive customs, such as that on wedding ceremonies, only
steamed sticky rice and tea should be offered on the ancestor altars, and
there is no need to prepare any big feasts or select auspicious dates, as long
as it is held on the 30, 1, 15 or 16 of lunar months . Also, the dead must be
buried within 24 hours and the coffin can be recycled, because he believed
that â€˜in dying, everyone is equalâ€™.  
â€˜Many of the old traditions set by Mr Tran are still up kept by the people
here,â€™ said Mr Mui. The religion is however non-existent elsewhere, says Dr
Dinh Van Hanh.  
After 10 years of residing in Long Son, Mr Tran appealed to believers for
contribution to build some good houses made of rare wood. Some constructions
are now still inside NhÃ Lá»›n (the Big House) complex, which is recognized by
Vietnamese government as a national historical and cultural relic.

NhÃ Lá»›n, the big house on Long Son Island, Ba Ria – Vung Tau Province  
 _Photos: Leâ€ˆThang My  
_  
The complex of Big House is divided into three sections, including: the
worship section consisting of several houses joined together on nearly one
hectare close to the foot of a hill (which is called Nua Mountain by the
locals), the second section, about 5,000 square metres, is in front of the
first section, including an exhibition house displaying a boat that Mr Tran
used to travel to Long Son, an old market with three roof tile stalls left
(now selling beverages for visitors), two rows of wood houses 50 metres in
length, which were formerly used by passers-by and is now used as a free place
for visitors to stay overnight, and the third section, an area of about 5,000
square metres, where Mr Tranâ€™s tomb is surrounded by his family membersâ€™
and relativesâ€™ ones.  
The worship area has the architectural style of a Vietnamese villageâ€™s
communal house with many interconnected or overlapped houses.  
Right at the gate of the worship section is a spacious house where five older
women wearing the southern traditional black clothes (bÃ ba) were sitting and
making quid of betel. â€˜We are making quid of betel to offer on his altar,â€™
one of them explained and reminded me: â€˜You are only allowed to take
pictures outside. No taking photos inside.â€™  
I was whisked through my tour by a woman named Tu, and I felt lost, as if in a
labyrinth.  
Every house is mainly made of wood and has multiple columns. Each house has
dozens of worship cabinets and furniture, which are carved very elaborately.
It is said that Mr Tran collected a lot of tables, chairs, worship cabinets,
horizontal lacquered boards and decorations for altars across the country.  
After visiting the Big House, I was invited to a free vegetarian meal by Ms Tu
with an explanation: â€˜In the past, he often offered free meals for the poor
and travellers who missed the path or rested for the night. Following his
example, his descendants now also offer free meals for visitors in need.â€™  
When I reached â€˜the House of Rice Treatâ€™, which has a capacity for more
than 500 visitors, inside the worship section, I saw tens of huge stoves next
to the kitchen area. An old woman named Nam, who was picking vegetables, said:
â€˜I often come here to cook for visitors as a charitable deed. Almost every
follower of Ong Tran religion in Long Son Island has once come here to
contribute their labour.â€™ She said: â€˜On the maintenance, washing and
cleaning only, more than 300 people take turns to do them and tens are in
charge of working in the kitchen daily. On the two biggest festivals, which
are his death anniversary on 20 February of Lunar Calendar (31 March this
year) and Tet Trung Cuu (Double Nine Tet) on 9 September of Lunar Calendar (13
October, 2013) every year, there are thousands of people attending.â€™

20 km to the southwest of Vung Tau cityâ€™s centre. There is a bridge
connecting the National Road No. 51 to the island. From Ho Chi Minh City,
follow the National Road No.1 about 25 km to the northeast, you will reach

Saigon-Suoi Nhum Resort.  
_Photo: Saigon-Suoi Nhum Resort  
_

While moving along the immense shoreline lying south of Phan Thiet, in the
direction just opposite of over-touristy Muine, one observes the peaceful and
charming scenes of coastal village life; the lush groves of graceful slim-
bodied Casuarinaceae trees stretching their sea breezeâ€“swept tops high up to
the tropical sun and groups of locals taking a bite under their cool shadow,
rural houses lamed in white and picturesquely framed with palm trees drooping
with fully-ripe coconuts and hotels and resorts still sparsely scattered here
and there with limitless spaces of the blue ocean in the background.  
Iâ€™m enjoying a bolide speed drive on a public bus full of local women, each
covered in ninja-like gowns to escape the omnipresent rays of the sun at noon,
which bite oneâ€™s skin like red hot chili peppers; a full bunch of barefoot
men with gaspers are hanging on handrails, each turn of the road sending them
flying together with clouds of sand rising from the bus floor. The roadscapes
in spots occasionally remind me of the Wild West shots with fanciful
silhouettes of magnolias in full flower instead of cactuses growing on both
sides of the road. I hop off after a 20-minute drive from Phan Thiet and race
across the sizzling hot road into the saving shade of Saigon-Suoi Nhum Resort
premises where Iâ€™ m booked. In the huge lobby of the main building, erected
in the monumental traditions of Italian baroque, so surprising to find within
rustic naturescapes, the giant wooden eagle has spread his wings wide, ready
to accord a hearty welcome to the guests.  
The aged porter guides me through the lush palm trees and magnolia garden to
the sea view bungalow. It impresses one even from the outside with an open-air
veranda spacious enough to contain a coffee table with chairs and cozy beach
bed. The last one, together with peaceful verdant surroundings and the
ultramarine body of the sea a few steps away, seduces one to give oneself
immediately to all kinds of meditation; visual meditation when contemplating
the juicy leaves and brightly-colored flowers in the garden, the still surface
of a seawater pool behind the bungalow, the sea itself, being so close,
rolling and toying with its white horses, then acoustic meditation when
listening to the breeze in the tops of the trees, the sound of the dry leaves
falling down to earth and the clear sound of the waves.  
Stepping out of the resort garden onto the sandy beach and seeing the
uninterrupted spaces of the ocean and the shoreline running on both sides
until the very horizon fills oneâ€™s sight, is a striking experience. The
grandeur of the scene gets more intense with both the sun and the moon clearly
seen on the canvas of the sky. On both sides, as far as the eye can reach, not
a single human silhouette, only the small fishing fleet of round basket boats
parked on the sand and the rocks standing out of the water spectacularly in
the far distance. People seem to have exited en masse from this mesmerizingly
beautiful coastal area, having surrendered the full immensity of the space to
the yin and yang of the sea and the sands.  
When walking along the shore with the sunset approaching, I observed living
souls appear: the locals with fishing tackle, skillfully casting ten lines per
capita, dark chocolate-colored kids and adults splashing in the waves and old
ladies darning fishing nets with big fish-bone like needles.  
Back at Saigon-Suoi Nhum Resort, I prowled around its premises in the
twilight, trying to find my bungalow in the lush groves of a 2-square ha
garden with twin lines of bungalows framed by a pair of cozy restaurants
decorated with wood and tiles with patio seating under the dome of dense
foliage. The big pool, brightly lit by full moon, lured me to take a long
swim, then lazily drift under the stars with only a family of Egyptian cats
cozying themselves under sun loungers to share the beauty of the moment. The
deck around the pool suddenly metamorphosed itself into a stage, with the sea
moving its giant body like a Japanese bhuto dancer under the beaming soffits
of the moonlight. The deck on both sides gradually transformed into
fluorescent white sands with Casuarinaceae treesâ€™ coppice growing upon them
and light wooden garden benches acting as loges. The ocean, obviously affected
by the full of the moon, roared deeply. The feeling of wilderness and the
primeval power of nature thrilled and captivated. Finally, the waves chased me
back to the desert shore, where the perfect disc of the moon peered down on
the giant glass of seawater broken with waves. It was already close to
midnight when I noticed the wandering lights approaching by land from the
distance. My tension mounted, but the resortâ€™s night guard, who was striding
along the garden and watching my back, helped to keep things at an even keel.
Upon closer look, the lights appeared to be wandering night â€˜huntersâ€™,
scavenging for plastics carried to the shore with night tide. The grandeur of
the seascapes by night was really hard to part with; I escaped it step by step
watching the sea first from the beach then from the resort gates, then from
the benches in the garden and finally from the veranda of the bungalow.  
Next morning, I headed to the Ke Ga lighthouse, first of its kind in the
country, according to the guidebook, and built in 1899 by the French. Itâ€™s
perched on a small island 6 km from Saigon-Suoi Nhum Resort with the stunning
sandy headland at its back and uninterrupted ocean ahead. The islet with
lighthouse is just asking to be painted and can be reached immediately by
swimming or by whisking there in one of the basket boats parked in plenty on
the shore. It is divided from the mainland with a picturesque bay and animated
by small sea vessels of all kinds, with basket boats skillfully equipped with
Yamaha motors. Here, the peaceful images of coastal life can be observed at
their full beauty; sun and sea breeze-beaten sailors dragging their
cockleshells with a good take of squids out on the shore. That part of the
scene can be bought, cooked and eaten right on the spot. Once on the shore,
the catch is sorted out and bought up in minutes by owners of small eateries
scattered along the seashore. The Ke Ga lighthouse is easily reached by local
bus or on foot along the beautiful seashore to the south from the resort. By
travelling further south along the highway, one can enjoy the spectacular
coastal sights mixed with colorful dragon fruit plantations, juicy green rice
fields and â€˜snowdriftsâ€™ of salt-licks stretching till the Ta Ku mountain
with a splendid concrete Buddha statue at the summit.  
Located amidst truly spectacular nature surroundings away (but within reach if
needed) from a broad path well-trodden by tourists, Saigon-Suoi Nhum Resort
features every amenity of a 4-star resort and various types of 4-star
accommodation, from casually elegant standard rooms with balconies to
bungalows and suites with an outdoor garden bath, allowing one to enjoy
alluring beauty and sweet solitude of the wilder coastal area in complete
comfort. Since its opening, Saigon-Suoi Nhum Resort has successfully hosted
various events with as many as 1200 persons. It possesses a great as-yet
undiscovered potential as a destination for yoga and meditation group travels.

11/20/2019,Putting it all together in Malaysia,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/putting-it-all-together-in-malaysia/,,By Kha Tu Anh,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_4317.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_4331.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/NguyenMinhDUc_4759.jpg,"_(No.1, Vol.3, Jan-Feb 2013 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)  
_  
It was October, 2012 and I had a one-week trip to Malaysia, at the invitation
of Tourism Malaysia to the press to attend the Motor Grand Prix 2012. After an
hour-and-a-half flight from Tan Son Nhat Airport, Ho Chi Minh City, I arrived
at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, to meet my guide, Eddie Chok, 43-year-
old Chinese Malaysian, working for Tourism Malaysia. The airport is gigantic
and beautifully designed.  
The weather in Malaysia was familiar to someone coming from Ho Chi Minh City.
It was hot-about 30C. It would be sunny, and then a deluge of rain would fall
from the skies, only to shut off as though someone had thrown a switch.  
On the way to Kuala Lumpur centre, I saw a lot of green palm oil and coconut
trees.  
As in many cities, most of the residential areas were on the outskirts of the
city. Houses were built in neat, uniform rows. They looked similar.  
The landscape of the suburbs was quite deserted. However, 40 minutes later,
when we reached the centre, it offered a much different view. The centre was
so modern and busy with huge skyscrapers, hotels, shopping malls, trams, two-
storey buses, a long row of cars on the street and a lot of tourists walking
on the pavement.

_  
I stayed in Grand Millennium hotel, on Jalan Bukit Bintang, a main street. The
street always was crowded with cars and tourists from noon to night. I saw a
lot of women in long, black dress, called abaya, covering their entire bodies
from top to bottom, everything except their eyes. I couldnâ€™t see their faces
even while they were eating. They put food in from under their masks. Eddie
told me they were Muslims from Middle East. Muslim women in Malaysia wear
scarf in their heads but cover their faces.  
From the hotel window, I saw rows of cars which looked, from my vantage point,
like a boyâ€™s collection of toy cars. The cars moved slowly in the perpetual
traffic jam. Unlike Saigon, however, I rarely heard a horn in the street.  
Eddie advised me not to take a taxi parked in front of a hotel, because these
taxis charged more.  
According to information provided by Tourism Malaysia, Malaysia is 329,750
square km. Population in Malaysia in 2007 was 27 million including 50.4 per
cent Malaysian, 23.7 per cent Chinese and 7.1 per cent Indian and 7.8 per cent
others. The official language is Malay. Besides English, Chinese and Indian
are used often.  
Kuala Lumpur is a paradise for shopaholics. Many famous world brands are
featured in shopping malls such as Pavilion, Fahrenheit, SKIL and M&H. The
shopping malls open at 10 a.m. and close at 10 p.m. A marketing employee at
Sunway Pyramid Shopping Mall, outside Kuala Lumpur, told me that all shopping
malls and outlets in Malaysia usually offer a discount of to 60 per cent to 70
per cent from July to August and November to January every year.  
I loved the walking tunnels that connected shopping malls and hotels from
Pavilion. Following a walking tunnel, I came to Trader Hotel, and went to the
top floor to gaze at the Petronas tower, 452 metres tall, and the cityâ€™s top
sight at night.  
People are very friendly and not too shy to start a conversation with
foreigners, but there are, of course, rules. Eddie told me not to touch a
childâ€™s head and not to kiss someone in public places. He said that men
would shake hands when meeting each other but women would put their right hand
on their left shoulder and bow.

I visited Putrajaya City, the new capital of Malaysia, 25 km away from Kuala
Lumpur. All government offices are here. Standing at Seri Wawasan Bridge, I
admired the beauty of a city of trees. The man-made Putra Lake, 650 ha, was
below me. The Putra Mosque, pink, with onion-shaped domes, looked like a grand
palace mirroring in the lake. It can seat 20,000. The huge building at the end
of a street is the Financial Ministry. A friend told me it is built opposite
from Seri Wawasan Bridge on purpose. Seri Wawasan Bridge, the most beautiful
bridge among nine others in the city, looked like a sail. It is believed this
design will bring wealth for the Financial Ministry. Then, Eddie took me to a
dock to take a sunset cruise. The cost: MR30 ($10) to MR50 ($16.45) a person
an hour around the lake. The price depended on kinds of boats and included
drinks, snacks and fruit.  
I went to Sepang International Circuit, outside Kuala Lumpur, to see the
racing event Motor Grand Prix 2012. The Grand Prix is the longest-running
motorsport world championship, comprising 18 rounds in 14 different countries.
The event was on 19-21 October, 2012 and attracted thousands of spectators.
The race is 5,543 km long. There were many activities in the event, including
motorcycle exhibition, autograph session, motorcycle stunt show, go-karts with
riders and music.

_  
I arrived at Malacca (or Melaca), after two hourâ€™s driving from Kuala Lumpur
centre. Eddie told me a version about the origin of the cityâ€™s name; in the
olden times, a king and his soldiers operated to this area and took a rest
below a big tree. Suddenly, a small fruit fell to the kingâ€™s body. He
climbed on the tree, picked the fruit, bit it and shouted â€˜Uhm . . . Ma . .
. La . . . Caâ€™. So, the area was called Malacca. The word does not have a
meaning. In fact, I tasted the fruit and understood why the king shouted,
because the fruit tasted at the same time bitter and sour. The city has
developed over 500 years into a trading post and cultural exchange point
between East and West. It was a World Heritage site, recognized by UNESCO in
2008. Malacca was ruled, in turns, by the Portuguese, Dutch and British. Eddie
took me to the Cheng Hoon Teng Temple, an old Chinese temple; Dutch Square
with red buildings along the streets and colourful trishaws; Maritime Museum,
a large wooden ship, exhibited ancient maps, model of ships and artefacts
relating the maritime history of Melaka; and Jonker Walk with hundreds of
Chinese shops along the street.  
I took a 45-minute flight to Senai Airport, in Johor near Singapore, from KLIA
Airport, and a 30-minute drive to a theme park, Legoland. It was launched in
September, 2012 as the first Legoland Park in Asia and the sixth one in the
world. It was set on a 76-acre area, divided into seven themes, and is
comprised of 15,000 Lego models, built from 50 million Lego bricks. The
highlight was Miniland, where Asian landmarks were recreated with more than 30
million Lego bricks, on a scale of 1:20. The price cost MR140 ($46) for adults
and RM110 ($36) for children from three to eleven and senior citizens over 60.  
Interestingly, despite all of the incredible architecture and scenery of the
cities, it was at Legoland where the beauty of Malaysia was perfectly
embodied. The imaginative toy block sculptures reminded me of the many
cultures of East and West, multi-coloured and interesting, fitting and working
together perfectly to create something beautiful that everyone can enjoy. I
hope to return to that country soon.

150km southeast of Ho Chi Minh City and 70km northeast of Vung Tau City, Binh
Chau â€“ Phuoc Buu Nature Reserve features flat terrain with rivers, springs,
lakes and seas.  
At present, there are 40 tourism enterprises, both international and domestic
ones, investing in the central and the surrounding areas of Binh Chau â€“
Phuoc Buu forest. One of these is the Binh Chau Mineral Hot Spring Ecotourism
Resort in Binh Chau commune.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/anh-64734.jpg)

The bilingual Vietnamese â€“ English leaflet of this resort says that in 1928,
on a field trip to research Vietnamese forests, a French doctor discovered a
hot-watered spring in the middle of the jungle and named it after the name of
the nearby village of Chau Ro ethnic, Cu My. By 1984, western scientists
evaluated that Cu My hot-watered springs had many components and
physicochemical properties similar to other famous hot-watered springs in the
world. Since then, Binh Chau Mineral Hot Spring Ecotourism Resort was
established and is now ranked 4-star, with an area of 33 ha.  
I bought an entrance ticket at VND30,000 per adult. As soon as I entered the
gate, I saw hotels, bungalows, restaurants, bars, souvenir stalls, tennis-
courts, golf courses, swimming pools, camping areas, recreation areas for
children. Most of these are under the cool shade of the forest trees. Small
paths paved with flagstones or bricks wind through one site to another.  
The resort has 70 sites, each spraying hot water ranging from 45oC to 82oC.  
Among the many activities such as crocodile fishing, tennis and visiting the
primitive forest by horse-cart, those related to hot-watered springs such as
foot bath, hot-watered bath and mineral hot mud bath attract most visitors.

With a ticket for foot bath at VND40,000 per adult, my friend and I entered a
shady section about 1,500 square meters with about 30 small pools, which
looked like bathtubs containing knee-level water. Each pool had some visitors
soaking their feet and chatting about the medical benefits of mineral hot
water.  
As soon as I dipped my feet into the water, I rushed to pull them up. The man
sitting next to me said: â€˜You feel too hot at first, but after several
minutes you will enjoy it.â€™ Just as the man said, after 15 minutes, I felt
my feet soothed.  
Next to the foot bath area are nine wells, 1.5 meters in depth, in which the
water is moving as if being boiled. Visitors can buy eggs from the shop nearby
and put them into bamboo baskets to drop down into the 82oC water, and then
wait for 15 minutes to serve.  
A local man said: â€˜20 years ago, whenever I caught any animals from the
forest, I would bring them here, butcher and soaked them into its hottest
pool, and then I picked them up after 20 minutes to eat them with rice wine.
The meat was so delicious.â€™  
At the section for â€˜mineral hot water bathâ€™, I bought a ticket for
VND150,000 and when I went inside, I saw two pools about 100 square meters in
size. As soon as I jumped into the water, I was startled to feel like I was
being abruptly plunged into boiling water. However, after 30 seconds, I felt
so relaxed and cozy that I spent an hour more to soak.  
Nearby are many huts for mineral mud bath at the price of VND400,000/ person.
A staff member took me to a 3m-by-3m hut with two bathtubs placed under the
ground, and then he tore open the mud bag and told me how to bathe.  
Following the instructions, I flushed the 37oC mineral hot water to fill in
the bathtub and soaked myself from top to toe for about 15 minutes, dried
myself and rubbed smooth pasty black mud all over me. Though the information
on the bag said â€˜37oC mineral hot mudâ€™, I just sensed slight warmth on my
skin. After 20 minutes blurred with the dark sludge, I took a bath again with
warm water and felt completely relieved.

In the afternoon, I went to the restaurant inside the resort and ate a plate
of rice with stir-fried squid and fish for a reasonable price. The restaurant
had hundreds of dishes such as chicken, pork, beef, ostrich, seafood, brackish
water and fresh water products. All of these dishes were listed in English and
Vietnamese.  
 _From Ba Ria Town centre, follow the National Highway No. 55 about 50 km to
the northeast, and you will reach Binh Chau fork at the milestone 46km and
800m, where you turn left and go about three km; there you find Binh Chau
mineral hot water spring ecotourism resort.  
The prices of the rooms at the resort are from VND800,000 to
VND6,000,000/night. There are tens of hotels and guesthouses with rooms for
two persons at VND100,000/night/ room with a fan or from VND150,000 to
VND200,000/night/room at Binh Chau commune centre, five km away from the
resort.

11/20/2019,The coconut king of Snail Island,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/the-coconut-king-of-snail-island/,,Text and pictures by Nguyen Dang Khoa,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/01erhed.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/03sdvsv.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/jdjdjkf.jpg,"_(No.12, Vol.2, Dec 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

At 8.3 kilometers in length and over one kilometer in width, Snail Island
(Cá»“n á»‘c) is right at the heart of Ham Luong River, which is a branch of
the Mekong, and flows through Hung Phong Commune, Giong Trom District, in Ben
Tre Province.  
Snail Island is the largest of Ham Luong River’s islands and covers an area of
647 hectares. This island used to be inhabited by lots of snails, which
explains the name, according to the Ben Tre Province’s official website.  
The other name of this island is Hung Phong.  
Following cement walks zigzagging through the island, I realized that the
walks lead to many coconut groves. The island is also dotted with houses made
of coconut wood and thatches roofed with coconut leaves.  
â€˜My grandfather told me that after the French invaded Vietnam in 1858, they
forced Vietnamese farmers to grow coconuts all over the island. This place was
one of the very first places to grow coconuts in Ben Tre Province before the
plant was grown virtually everywhere in the province,â€™ said a 70-year-old
senior.  
Ben Tre Province is known as the kingdom of coconuts.  
â€˜Coconuts have been part of many of the local customs such as weddings,
funerals, house building for centuries. The locals often used coconut leaves
to build pavilions for wedding ceremonies and funerals about 20 years ago,â€™
said an 80-year-old woman.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/01erhed.jpg)  
A cement walk leads to coconut groves.

There are lots of women sitting in front of their simple houses to make
furniture and souvenirs from coconut leaves. Coconut trunks and shells are
also used to make cute furniture and souvenirs.  
â€˜The current Snail Island population is about 1,300 households with nearly
6,000 people, and more than 500 households earn their living from coconut
products,â€™ said Tran Van Nghia, chairman of Hung Phong Commune’s People
Committee.  
I stopped for a sweet bean soup (chÃ¨) at a street shop. The thick coconut
milk in the shop inspired me to ask the shop’s owner about dishes prepared
from coconut.  
â€˜Hundreds of dishes can be made from coconut fruits. The core of young
coconut tree is also edible,â€™ said the woman.  
After roaming the island for two hours, word of mouth guided me to Mr Do Thanh
Thuong at No. 131, Hung Phu 1, who is known as â€˜The Coconut Kingâ€™.  
Mr Thuongâ€™s house is also walled and thatched from coconut wood and leaves,
its tin roof standing out as the only non-coconut product.  
Mr Thuong told me that he has worn the nickname â€˜Coconut Kingâ€™ since 1993,
when coconut prices dropped so low that coconut farmers had to chop down the
plants to switch to more profitable ones. Since his family had grown coconuts
for five generations, Mr Thuong simply did not have it in him. Then, a group
of researchers from Vegetable Oil Research introduced him to the new coconut
variety-PD12-and provided the seeds for him. The new coconut type yielded as
many as 150 nuts per tree only after two years. His success inspired many
famers in the Ben Tre Province to try their hand at growing this new variety.
Since then, Mr Thuong started making good money by being a local seedsman.  
The â€˜Coconut Kingâ€™ showed his two certificates to me. One of them
acknowledges him as the best coconut grower in Vietnam, and was awarded by the
Asia-Pacific Coconut Association in 1999. The other certificate is â€˜Tree of
Life,â€™ awarded by the International Seed Bank in 2004.  
â€˜Many domestic and international organizations have invited me to share my
experience in growing coconuts using both traditional and novel techniques,â€™
said Mr Thuong.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/03sdvsv.jpg)

Mr Thuong also plans to buy a coconut oil extracting machine to make cosmetics
and medicines from coconuts. He even dreams of building a coconut museum to
help tourists and the future generations to gain a better understanding of
life on the coconut land. More and more tourists, both international and
domestic, have visited Snail Island. Many travel companies already operate on
the island.  
â€˜Many foreign visitors have dropped by my house to taste my more 20 types of
coconuts and they fished and prepared the fish themselves. They had dinner
with me and spent the night here,â€™ Mr Thuong added.  
Realizing the tourism potential of the island, the Ben Tre Provinceâ€™s
Department of Planning and Investment has called for investments to build a
$30 million resort.  
This call was made even while the island has shown dramatic erosion due to the
exploitation of sand in the surrounding river.  
A local who wants to remain anonymous said that there have always been 20 to
30 boats with equipment to harvest sand from the river bed, causing serious
erosion for many houses and gardens. Three houses have fallen into the river.
â€˜Residents of Snail Island have lodged a complaint with authorities of the
district and commune. Nothing has changed yet, raising doubts that such
illegal exploitation is under the local authority’s protection.â€™  
â€˜The province’s authority granted permission for three companies to exploit
sand in the waters surrounding Snail Island three years ago. It’s not illegal
exploitation,â€™ said the commune’s chairman.  
â€˜It is such dramatic exploitation that causes serious erosion. However, we
have not calculated the erosion area statistically. The locals have filed
complaints to the province’s authority so many times. Yet, the province’s
authority insisted that the exploitation is perfect for water flows, and so
could not do any harm to the island,â€™ said the afore-mentioned anonymous
local.  
â€˜Since the local residents are so angered with the answer from the
province’s authority, they have fought many times with sand-exploiters. In
turn, the sand-exploiters have hired gangsters to fight back against the
locals,â€™ he said.

**How to get to the Snail Island  
** _Get a VND40,000 bus ticket to Ben Tre at the Mien Tay Bus Station in Ho
Chi Minh City. From the centre of Ben Tre, head for and cross the Ben Tre
Bridge, and keep going until the roundabout. Turn left to Highway 887, keep
going straight for 10km to the Hung Long Ferry Terminal. The ferry can take
you to the island.  
Or, you can hire a tourist boat under the Ben Tre Bridge, which costs VND300,
000 per hour and seats up to 12 people. It takes from 2.5-3 hours to get to
the island by boat.

Vietnam is known as the â€œLand of Dragons.â€ It is one destination for which
any amount of praise seems inadequate. The countryâ€™s natural and historical
attractions appeal to many visitors from all parts of the globe. Today, the
largely agrarian country is shifting towards a more multi-sector economy. The
country has a wealth of dialects spoken in different regions. There is almost
no end to the breath-taking sites visitors can see in this fascinating
country.  
The great theme of modern Vietnamese history is the Vietnamâ€™s war of
independence and reunification. The Vietnam War proved to be an extremely
sobering experience that caused so much suffering for the Vietnamese people.
The people of the country have a well-deserved reputation for being hard
workers, but they enjoy their leisure as much as anyone else. Ho Chi Minhâ€™s
name comes to mind when we remember the recent history of Vietnam. He is the
best-loved and famous political figure in the country. Ho Chi Minh the founder
of the Vietnamese Communist Party and, as leader of the revolution, carried
the torch of Vietnamâ€™s independence movement for over half a century. As a
revolutionary he made great contributions to the victorious Viet Minh and Viet
Cong forces that unified the country. Mausoleum Ho Chi Minh, a monumental
marble edifice at Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi, was built to show the deep
gratitude of the countrymen to their great leader. His remains are displayed
inside the chamber of the mausoleum. Hanoi, the capital city known as â€œcity
of lakes,â€ is a thriving metropolis with cloud-tickling skyscrapers,
numerous specialty shops, boutiques and colourful markets that unhesitatingly
leap into the future. A visit to the country would remain incomplete if one
doesnâ€™t drive a 3½-hour journey on road from Hanoi to Halong Bay port. The
five- hour cruise in a double-deck wooden boat in the bluish green waters can
be an enjoyable boat excursion. The UNESCO world Heritage site Halong (or
“Descending Dragon) Bay is situated amidst a splendid panorama. The bay covers
an area of 1500-square-kilometres dotted with a cluster of 1,960 limestone
islands.  
Hue is in the central part of the country. It is studded with many
archaeological sites. Among these are the feudal capital city with fortresses,
temples, mausoleums, pagodas and bridges that attract thousands daily. The
Perfume River is famed for offering a river cruise in a traditional wooden
boat.  
Travelling from the North to the South of Vietnam can be a fantastic
experience for a tourist. Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the largest city in
Vietnam and is situated nearly 1,700 kilometres south of Hanoi. After the end
of war, Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honour of the great Leader. It
is a city of rapid development, where modern buildings are raised right beside
19th-century buildings. An array of giant cranes shows the development fever
in the city. Among its highest-esteemed attractions are the Notre Dame
Cathedral, the Municipal Theatre, the re-unification palace, the Mekong river
cruise, the Cá»§ Chi tunnels and the Vietnam War Memorial Museum. The Vietnam
War memorial museum is one of the most recognizable places to visit in the
city. It is a living testimony to the history of the Vietnamâ€™s war of
independence and re-unification. It is a place preserving the memories and
relics of the Vietnam War.  
The country has tended to preserve its traditional music, theatre and dance
offering visitors the opportunity to experience an ancient forms much as they
were hundreds of years ago. Vietnamese art possesses several distinctive
characteristics that give it its own unique style. There are grottos, temples
and pagodas that are still there for the young generation understand their
roots and origin. If one is to understand and experience the surprises of the
cultures of the world, Vietnam surely is a voyage not to be missed.

11/20/2019,Dalat offers romantic mountain escape,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/dalat-offers-romantic-mountain-escape/,,By Peter Kauffner,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Chicken-village---dalat-By-.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/PHO-CO-DA-LAT.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/017.jpg,"_(No.9, Vol.2, Sep 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

Where should we go on vacation?â€™ Dalat is the traditional answer for
residents of Saigon and other southern cities, the one that still comes to
mind first. This is a city of flowers, lakes, and waterfalls, as well as an
escape from urban heat.  
â€˜When Saigon people take a short vacation, they go to Vung Tau,â€™ said
Ngoc, a second-year student at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City.
â€˜When they want to take a longer trip, they go to Dalat.â€™ Ngoc herself has
been to Dalat four times.  
Dalat is the most accessible city in the Central Highlands. At 1,500 m above
sea level, the climate is dramatically cooler than it is on the coast. The
average daily temperature for May is 17Â°C to 26Â°C, compared to 25Â°C to
34Â°C for Saigon. The month has an average of 18 days of rain, the same as for
Saigon.  
The city is famed for its flowers, so donâ€™t miss the Dalat Flower Garden
next to Xuan Huong Lake. This lake is 5 km across and is located near the
centre of town. The Dalat wild rose gives the city a sweet smell of its own.
In winter, the marigold trees blossom.  
â€˜Dalat is very beautiful,â€™ added Linh, another economics student. â€˜I
like flowers. I have many pictures at the flower festival in Dalat.â€™  
When the governor of French Indochina asked the famed physician Alexandre
Yersin to recommend a location for a health spa, Yersin answered â€˜Dalat.â€™
At that time, hill tribes dominated this area. One such tribe is the Lat, and
â€˜Da Latâ€™ translates as â€˜stream of the Lat.â€™ Medical opinion at the
time associated tropical climate with diseases like malaria. The new city,
founded in 1912, would be a healthy environment, a place of refuge where the
ill could recover.  
A dam built in 1919 created a small lake, and this was enlarged in the 1930s.
The surrounding highland wilderness was a hunterâ€™s paradise, filled with
tiger, elephant and rhino. The city was a favourite of Bao Dai, Vietnamâ€™s
last emperor, whose three palaces are now tourist attractions. Dalat Tower, on
top of the main post office, is a replica of the Eiffel Tower. Nowadays, Dalat
is for honeymooners.  
â€˜When I get married, I will go to Dalat,â€™ said Linh. â€˜It is very
romantic.â€™  
An outstanding attraction is Prenn Falls, located about 10 km from the city.
This is where the honeymooners get their pictures taken dressed up as
tribesmen or riding horses. There are many other waterfalls in the area, the
largest of which is Pongour, located 34 km south of the city.

One thing Dalat doesnâ€™t lack is touristy nicknames: Petite Paris (little
Paris), City of Flowers, City of Love, and City of Thousands of Pine Trees. In
an article published in 1937, French author AndrÃ© Morval created a Latin
motto: Dat Aliis Laetitiam Aliis Temperiem (Pleasure to some, freshness to
others). The initials of this clever word puzzle spell out the cityâ€™s name.  
The Valley of Love is a park that caters to the honeymooners. There are
â€˜love statues,â€™ horse rides, boat rides, and photography stands. On
Valentineâ€™s Day, the park has a kissing competition in which couples kiss
for as long as they can. Vietnamese-style love is not for everyone; Westerners
find it more tacky than romantic. It exhibits the â€˜love of the unnatural; of
artifice and exaggeration,â€™ as Susan Sontag defined â€˜campâ€™. But the park
is still a must see, if only as a cultural artefact.  
After visiting the Valley of Love, Vietnamese visitors typically go to the
market in the centre of town and load up on produce. Jam, coffee, tea, local
wine, and dried venison are considered excellent gifts.  
Hang Nga Crazy House, built in 1992, is another stop on the Dalat love
express. â€˜Hang Ngaâ€™ translates as â€˜moon sister.â€™ The expressionist
architecture, inspired by Spanish architect Antoni GaudÃ­, avoids straight
lines and makes the building look a bit like a giant tree. As a house for
lovers, it is full of mirrors.  
It was designed and built by Dang Viet Nga, the daughter of former President
Truong Chinh. Modern architecture didnâ€™t go down well with the city fathers,
and they attempted have it torn down 1993. Nga went over the heads of the
local authorities and pleaded her case with her fatherâ€™s old friends in
Hanoi. The building is now one of Dalatâ€™s top attractions.  
Although you canâ€™t take the train to Dalat, it does have a train station.
The train is an old-fashioned steam engine you can ride for 7 km to Linh
Phuong pagoda. Built in the 1930s, it once connected Dalat to main North-South
line at Thap Cham. The rack railroad through the mountains was considered
quite an engineering feat in its day, the pride of French Indochina.  
Another ride with a view is the cable car. This lifts you high over Quang
Trung Reservoir and gives you a spectacular view.  
â€˜When I take the cable car, I have a lot of time to chat with my parents or
my boyfriend,â€™ Linh said.  
Guided treks of the countryside and of tribal villages are popular. Lat
Village has a large statue of a chicken. Ask your guide why. They are all
eager to tell the story, and several explanations exist.  
Many hill women do embroidery using a special loom worked with both hands and
feet. The first time I went to Dalat, I met a hill tribe girl. â€˜If you want
to marry me, come back with ten buffalo,â€™ she said. I went back to meet her
several times, but I never brought any buffalo.  
Dalat is seven hours by bus from Saigon, five from Nha Trang. From Saigon you
can use Mai Linh Express, 201 Pham Ngu Lao, or Phuong Trang, 272 De Tham. The
fare is about VND100,000. There is an airport as well, with daily flights from
both Saigon and Hanoi. The city has hotels everywhere and thereâ€™s no need
for air conditioning. Ten dollars a night is a typical. If you can afford $100
(VND2,100,000) to $230 (VND4,830,000) a night, you can live in an authentic
colonial villa at the award-winning Ana Mandara Villas.

All I knew as I stepped out of the taxi into Saigon Station was that Car No 5,
Seat 15, requested my presence at 6:50 a.m. sharp, and two days later a
similar train would launch me homeward at another prescribed time officially
stamped in black ink on thick paper. At the time, these tickets for a
roundtrip Saigon-PhanThiet journey served as nothing more than two tidy
bookends to an adventure still awaiting its narration.  
After settling into a coach reminiscent of Eastern Europe circa 1983, I
marvelled at how the dozens of vinyl seats collected such a motley crew of
people with varying missions yet all sharing one common goal of arriving in
this coastal town. Were I to have closed my eyes, the train’s rhythmic
clickety-clack, clickety-clack could have been at home anywhere in the world,
but the only-in-Vietnam scenes whizzing past my dust-streaked window were
anything but.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06387.jpg)  
Sidewalk scene in Phan Thiet

Low-slung streetscapes of tin-roof concrete shacks crumbling along narrow
once-paved streets now pulverized into rock and dust reminded me of a
different Vietnam I had met fifteen years earlier during a week’s vacation.
Our train rolled on another four hours through green countryside time’s
forward march seemingly has forgotten to take along for the ride. I began
daydreaming and wishing I were on the other side of the glass.  
I would hazard a guess that most people use travel as an escape vehicle to
numb senses stressed from everyday life. Others venture forth into the world
to reawaken faculties numbed by those very same daily toils. I fall into the
latter camp with my only goal uncovering something of a memorable Phan Thiet
nature nonexistent in my own backyard. What lay ahead I did not know for I had
commenced this expedition without the advice of the internet, guidebooks, word
of mouth, or any other such research a well-prepared traveler might undertake.
Sometimes the best way to unveil an areaâ€™s hidden secrets is simply to
become lost in its streets.  
Staying at the well-appointed Villa Del Sol resort in TienThanh Beach 14
kilometres distant from Phan Thiet town proved a double-edge sword. On the one
hand, this self-contained oasis set against stunning beach views provides the
perfect meditative Zen for rest and recuperation. Yet on the other,
sequestration inside these hermetically sealed confines could prove that fait
accompli shielding me from the local interaction I so crave for collecting
random once-in-a-lifetime cultural experiences that has become my travelling
mantra.  
I asked the front desk staff if they could perhaps recommend a local
restaurant to kick start my explorations. Ms Phuong quickly countered with,
â€œWhy do you want that? We have a restaurant here.â€ Even after explaining
my desire to dine with the locals in the most local of food shops, she seemed
quite perplexed before finally dismissing my inquiries with a stern warning
that â€œlocal quality might not be good for westerners.â€ Seeing that I was
far from sending the white flag of surrender up the flagpole, she hesitantly
scribbled the name of a restaurant on a slip of paper that would soon become
my admission ticket to a fascinating journey far from anything I could have
ever imagined only hours before on that train.  
Renting a motorbike of suspect repair for VND315,000 a day provided two-
wheeled freedom to break through the invisible barrier of the hotelâ€™s neatly
manicured grounds into the more rough and tumble environs of BinhThuan
Province more suitable to my peculiar tastes. The insertion of my western
driving skills into Phan Thietâ€™s no-rules flow of traffic likely left a
trail of destruction in my wake. Motorists in this town sense some sort of
order quite elusive to me amongst the bedlam zipping through the streets, and
their quizzical looks burned right through me as I sputtered along in Tran
Hung Dao Streetâ€™s right lane at one quarter the speed of kamikaze
grandmothers whizzing past like slingshot projectiles.  
One final, harrowing left turn against an onslaught of careening motorbikes
pouring across a short bridge over the Ca Ty River brought me for the second
time in so many days to Ms. Phuongâ€™s recommendation. I stood in front of Kim
Anh Quanâ€™s faded concrete walls at 28A Trung Trac Street and basked in all
that is right about a proper Vietnamese feeding hole the average tourist
likely will miss.  
The ownerâ€™s enthusiasm for my loyal patronage showed with an ear-to-ear grin
as he ushered me to a choice table underneath a coveted wall-mounted fan. The
humidity may have been high enough to saturate the morning air inside this
mom-and-pop type establishment yet could do little to dampen my appetite. The
breakfast menuâ€™s selection was a veritable whoâ€™s who of noodle-based
soups, and I was proud to have actually mustered up a rough translation for
about half of the exotic sounding vittles.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06202.jpg)  
Transporting fish in baskets from the boat to delivery trucks

A quick game of eenie, meenie, miney, mo landed my finger on há»§ tiáº¿u háº£i
sáº£n seafood noodle soup whose sweet liquid with a subtle fish infusion
proved so delectable I consciously slowed my normally supersonic eating to a
more glacial pace. The perfectly cooked shrimp, octopus, and squid piqued my
curiosity as to what lay in the ocean beyond, and a nearby sidewalk vendorâ€™s
dessert of dragon fruit with scarlet flesh whetted even more my insatiable
hunger for off-the-beaten-path exploration.  
This cluster of streets soon became the hub of my rapidly expanding universe
for immersion into all things Phan Thiet, and from there I fanned out into the
countryside with about as much subtlety as the Big Bang Theory. Stopping short
of a bridge across a rather pungent waterway choked with refuse and the other
assorted hubris of the human footprint landed me right in the middle of a no-
frills outdoor street market at the corner of Thu Khoa Huan and Nguyen Huu
Tien Streets.  
As I wandered amongst tables deeply stained with the telltale DNA of raw
market commerce, I noticed a table of a different sort had quickly turned. In
mere steps I had gone from casual observer to the object of intense scrutiny
myself as the locals keenly watched my every move with a very vocal narration.
People do not just descend upon these markets as I had for a casual window-
shopping walkabout, and old women on a mission impatiently pushed around me
without apology. I suddenly felt like a broken cog hindering this churning
wheel of commerce.  
I was drowning in a pool of laughter and finger-pointing as I studied a
display of dried fish perfuming anyone downwind with their unique eau-de-
market essence. Lingering just a second too long caused the napping, yet
amazingly clairvoyant, saleswoman to somehow awaken and commence the hard
sell. Several matriarchs motioned for me to try a piece, and oh how I wished I
could have asked them beforehand if the taste would prove as rancid as the
odiferous fumes.  
Hook, line and sinker, these women pulled me well outside my comfort zone, and
I carefully chose the least offensive looking specimen. Wow, did that one tiny
nibble pack a potent punch best described as a tough beef jerky texture
marinated in a fishiness of steroidal proportions! Evidently my new found
friends had wagered whether or not I would dare consume such a delicacy. When
the roulette wheel landed on â€˜He ate it!â€™ half erupted into rapid-fire
murmurs while the rest walked away shaking their heads.  
As I politely sought a graceful, no-purchase required exit, little did I know
that I would soon retrace this fishâ€™s journey from ocean to my now healing
tastebuds. This piquant taste of PhanThiet cuisine unwittingly became the
focal point of my journey deep into the countryside and would make the most
random of appearances along the way.  
Not even a few minute’s drive beyond the market, a trash-strewn strip of
riverside real estate pulsed with a beehive of loud activity near 65 Nguyen
Thong Road. Slight women hidden beneath conical hats buzzed back and forth
between a steady flow of narrow wooden boats and delivery trucks.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/beach.jpg)  
Peachful seaside scene south of Phan Thiet

Expecting a similar sting of glares and stares as in the market, I sloshed
through the muddy asphalt in between stacks of crated silver fish and wall-to-
wall people.The pursuit of earning a living from the day’s catch proved more
compelling than wondering why a western guy was milling about, and in a manner
so unlike Vietnam, my presence was completely ignored other than for women
occasionally using their fish-stained hands against my once clean shirt to
repeatedly reposition me out of their way.  
In one curve of the asphalt just beyond this mecca of fish distribution, Mui
Ne’s highly developed, very westernized, and for me at least, antithesis of
everything Vietnamese I sought now monopolized my thoughts. I paused in front
of a shop bursting with gaudy Hawaiian style beachwear, neon coloured bathing
suits, and tacky souvenirs and suddenly began craving another walk through
that earlier street market so ripe with sounds and smells of a more proper
commerce. Set down a McDonalds and Burger King at either end of Mui Ne’s main
drag, and its metamorphosis into a western enclave would prove complete.  
This part of Mui Ne fortunately became a mere speck in my rear view mirror as
I motored my way into the actual town proper. Hillside Nguyen Minh Chau Street
sent me on a steep, gravity-enhanced trajectory towards the ocean well beyond
my motorbike’s braking capabilities, and at the bottom I landed mercifully
unscathed in an area well off the tourist trail. A potholed dirt road cutting
a path between very basic, one-storey concrete homes funneled me right into a
dusty area filled almost wall to wall with metal screens harvesting solar
power to transform thousands of fish into what I had earlier sampled.  
Right away I felt little in common with these surroundings other than a slow
bake under the same searing noonday sun. This road less traveled connected me
to others devoted largely to entire farms devoted to the drying of this tiny,
silver fish.  
The hotel’s open-air lobby barely had welcomed me home from my wanderings just
as a clap of thunder split open the heavy looking clouds to unleash a deluge.
I asked Ms. Nhung for advice on where to sample another PhanThiet specialty,
sun-dried squid. This final rainy evening at Villa del Sol taught me that
sometimes in our quest far and wide for the unusual, what we seek could be
nearby, right under our noses.  
As she carefully deliberated with pursed lips and intense concentration in her
eyes, Mr Thoai told me to hop in his golf cart. Off we went into the pouring
rain to a coffee shop about three minutes distant, where I bought eight pieces
out of a regular household refrigerator. Right on the spot I was ready to sink
my teeth into the rubbery flesh, yet in the nick of time Mr Thoai pulled my
hand away from my mouth with an animated Mr John, no, no, no, no, no!  
Evidently sun-dried still means raw, and five minutes on the hotel’s grill
would bring this treat to crispy, now edible perfection. Since these
unfamiliar dishes never seem to arrive tableside with an instruction manual
for the Western novices amongst us, deeply thankful I was my new friends could
show me the ropes. Though we only knew just enough of each other’s languages
to barely function beyond the preschool level of How old are you? and What is
your name? we shared a wonderful, laughter-filled dinner.  
As we greedily separated chewy strips from the squid and dragged them through
a spicy, fish-sauce-based _nước chấm_ dipping sauce, I pondered how food
really does harbor the power to unite us all by transcending cultures. My
journey’s final hours were ironic indeed for only days earlier I had eschewed
the hotel as a proper venue where I could get to know Phan Thiet off the
beaten path. Quite to the contrary, I made a personal connection with several
people from this nation that has hosted me for two dozen months.  
Homeward bound riding the rails, Saigon’s lights filled the quickly darkening
void as dusk began pulling the sun’s last waning rays into its murky clutches.
My train glided through District 3, cutting a close trail past brightly
illuminated, open store fronts. Each narrow structure housed a split second,
yet highly unfiltered glimpse, into local life. Within the blink of an eye, I
spied a shirtless man jumping up and down on stacked cardboard in a futile
attempt to compact it further, a young woman hunched over a sewing machine in
a room overflowing with fabric, and a group of men raising beer mugs in a
toast under a naked light bulb hanging from a wire.  
Time has tempered my once awe-struck reaction to these scenes, and I now
absorb this city’s familiarity in a different, more mundane light. My journey
to Phan Thiet had come full circle as the train lurched into Saigon Station,
and I said something to myself for the first time in two years: “I am home.”  
The hotel’s amicable and helpful general manager, Mr Vinh, would later explain
via email, The fish you saw, we call anchovy. If it is still fresh, people can
eat. But if it is not fresh, people can dry it to eat later by cooking or they
can make fish sauce. The truth is I saw more than just ca com drying in the
sun. I gained a fresh perspective on a life and culture so unlike my own.
Mission accomplished.

I first set eyes on her a week or so after arriving in Vietnam for the first
time in 1997. She is a lady with quite a history. I was based at that time in
Dong Hoi, another, smaller town in central Vietnam and business would draw me
to Hue quite often so I got to know her quite well. That was the year the
Saigon Tourist company took control of her, rescuing her from a few years of
serving only backpackers. She first opened her doors in 1901 and her glory
years lasted up to the departure of the French in 1954. Then, quite
understandably, with the mood of the country turning against foreign
domination, she ceased to be a hotel. From 1957 until 1990 she was part of Hue
University. Even in 2006 a room could be secured here for under 50 dollars.
Now, however, she has been restored to her former glory, with a new floor
added, providing 53 more rooms. I was recently invited to sample a stay and
enjoy the experience of knowing the classy grand dame at closer quarters.  
I have been referring to the hotel as if she were a lady mature in years but
still retaining grace and beauty. I believe this is fitting particularly as
the term â€˜Grande Dameâ€™ is French and this is a place that whilst
definitely Vietnamese still very much keeps its French airs. Care and
hospitality are feminine strengths well in evidence at the â€˜Morinâ€™. This
is a very beautiful building both in its architecture and decoration and these
too of course are attributes of the fair sex. Furthermore there is fine food
to be enjoyed here and as everybody knows â€˜Motherâ€™ is the best cook. Yes,
I know a few feminist guns will try to shoot me down on this but for me they
are an extremist element of their movement. They would do well to splinter off
and form their own â€˜Femnaziistâ€™ faction in my humble opinion.  
The Morin is a tiered oblong edifice. Adding to its femininity it is currently
painted pink and stands back just a few metres from the lapping waters of a
river called Perfume. Iconic herself she faces another Hue icon the Truong
Tien girder bridge. The front ground floor houses a restaurant, souvenir shop
and reception. There is also a coffee lounge area with computers for hire at
110,000 dongs an hour. Needless to say in this day and age of the smart phone
no one was using them and anyway the back packer area where they charge 2,000
dongs an hour is just around the corner. Saigon Tourist company the owner is a
little slow to realise that todayâ€™s traveller regards Internet access as
much a part of the package as TV in the room.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Hotel-Saigon-Morin---Anh-co.jpg)  
A photo of Hue railway station in 1938 hanging on the wall along the corridor
at Saigon Morin

From here you pass into a truly beautiful garden courtyard with an imposing
Calabar almond tree (cÃ¢y bÃ ng) planted in 1900 at its centre. There are also
large colourful ornamental jars with glazed oriental scenes on them as well as
bonsais in ceramic pots to remind you that you not in France but Vietnam. In a
cordoned-off area at the back as part of the refurbishments there is now a
large new swimming pool with paddling pool. There is a poolside bar and a
doorway leads you to the beauty salon and spa where you can indulge in all the
treatments one can expect of a hotel of this category.  
Upstairs the rooms are aligned along classic long corridors. Black and white
period posters adorn the walls telling the whole history of the hotel and Hue.
There are menus in French, dated pictures of the bridge and river, portraits
of the original Morin brothers and their family as well as of dignitaries who
have stayed in these rooms. I was particularly intrigued to see an old
snapshot of travellers arriving at Hue train station to be met by rickshaws
and their pullers. You are reminded too as to how successful the Morins were
with faded photos of their hotels in Quy Nhon, Danang and the Ba Na hills. I
fell into such a reverie that I imagined Charlie Chaplin coming out of one of
the rooms and bumping into me in this corridor.  
You cannot of course meet him but I was given the honour of an inspection of
the Charlie Chaplin suite. The great man slept here along with newly wedded
wife actress Paulette Goddard on their 1936 Orient tour. You step back in time
as you enter these rooms. There is a big brass gramophone, dark hardwood
furnishings, a well stocked library, four poster bed and many Vietnamese
ceramic jars and pots. It even has its own bar stocked with upper-end
alcoholic drinks.  
The comic tramp had the last laugh staying in this luxurious hotel.  
The room I stayed in was of course smaller but befitting of its deluxe
category. There was a great view of the bridge and the river with an islet in
the distance. At night I watched the crowds milling around the night market on
the waterfront. Tea-and coffee-making facilities were included as well as a
full range of bathroom toileteries. There was even a mitt and polish for my
shoes. My daughter so liked the bathroom that she said she could sleep in it.
I especially liked the shiny, wax-polished wooden plank flooring â€“ very
European.  
There is fine dining at the Morin too. My wife, teenage daughter and I ate
outside in the Rendezvous Garden alongside the old tree. We had an eight-
course Vietnamese meal that was tip-top. Among the delights were sweet corn
and shrimp soup, steamed fish, grilled beef with lemongrass, stir-fried figs
with shrimp and pork and stewed chicken with mushrooms. The service was
impeccable and, something I have been campaigning for in Vietnamese hotels,
there was draught beer with which to wash the delicacies down. My Hue wife,
who has earned the sobriquet Madame Epicure, rated the dishes at between 8.5
and 9.5 out of ten.  
Sadly I felt that in one way justice was not being done to the chef. The place
was rather empty, with only one other table occupied. The reason for this is
overpricing in an extremely competitive neighbourhood. Perhaps the warning is
in the full name the â€˜Saigon Morin Hueâ€™. Saigon as we know refers to the
most expensive square mile in the country-District 1 of Ho Chi Minh city.
Earlier in the year one Mr Harald Bathgate in a letter to this magazine
eloquently warned that Vietnam could be losing tourists due to this. In this
case it simply does not make sense to lose revenue in this way. To press my
case further let me give you an example. I was charged 55,000 dongs for a
glass of the Tiger draught. A little further down the same street in luxurious
surroundings replicating dining in the Imperial Hue Palace I paid 18,000 dongs
for the same beer.

One other little foible, which reflects not on the hotel but on the owner, is
what the English menu loses in translation. It can be difficult to translate
Vietnamese dishes but the â€˜Rice pudding wrapped in banana leafâ€™ had us
confused. We thought that ambrosia dessert beloved throughout Europe and the
Middle East was about to arrive at the table. They meant â€˜bÃ¡nh bÃ¨oâ€™
which might be better translated as savoury rice-flour cakes. One would have
thought a company the size of â€˜Saigon Touristâ€™ would contract a more
professional translation service.  
Of all the grand colonial hotels in Vietnam the Morin is the one I love the
best. It has the loveliest location and it gives a real sense of 20th- century
history from the Charlie Chaplin era to the independence struggle. The recent
refurbishment has added comfort and more facilities to the place. The Morin
for me embodies the marriage of French elegance to Vietnamese charm and top-
quality service. A stay here, even it means stretching the budget a little,
will add to your experience of Vietnamâ€™s most alluring and historical city.

Xáº»o QuÃ­t, a flooded forest in the Mekong Delta province of Dong Thap, about
140km west of Ho Chi Minh City, was a revolutionary base in the Vietnam War
and heavily bombed. It was recognised by the Vietnamese Government as a
national historic site in 1994.  
I and a friend bought tickets into Xáº»o QuÃ­t for VND5,000 (US$25 cents).  
We were welcomed by three young women in the southern traditional black
blouse, called Ã¡o bÃ ba, checked scarves and wide-brimmed hats â€“ the
uniform of women guerrillas.  
A cadre named Nhung invited us and other visitors into a boat for a trip
around Xáº»o QuÃ­t for 30 minutes at VND10,000 (US$50 cents a person.  
â€˜If you want to row the boat yourself, you must rent a boat for VND40,000
($2) an hour,â€™ she said.  
One boat could seat four people.  
Ten boats were available at the time.  
I asked for a lifebuoy and Nhung said, â€˜The water only reaches your navel.
Donâ€™t worry.â€™  
Our boat, whose widest part was only 80 cm, rocked slightly for a few seconds
before Nhung, rowing standing up, made it surf smoothly on a channel about 1.2
m wide.  
Afternoon sunshine came through countless cajuput trees with lots of climbing
plants on them, making bright dots on the water.  
â€˜This forest is an area of about 50 ha, of which 20 ha is covered with
cajuput trees, Nhung said. â€˜In the flooded season, the average depth of
water in the whole forest is about a metre.â€™  
Nhung said the place was called Xáº»o QuÃ­t (xáº»o means canal and quÃ­t means
kumquat) because there used to be a lot of kumquat trees in the area. [It is
not known what happened to the kumquat trees., Ed.]  
In 1960, the Communist Party branch in Kiáº¿n Phong (currently Äá»“ng ThÃ¡p)
Province had chosen Xáº»o QuÃ­t for a secret base.  
For camouflage, they had grown cajuput trees [cÃ¢y trÃ m], which had become a
forest.  
They had tunnel, led and built fortifications, houses, a health centre and a
meeting room. The buildings had been abovewater, on reclaimed earth.  
The canal wound through the forest. The further we went, the merrier the
birdsong.  
Big birds were startled and flew away.

Qu.jpg)

Nhung said there were about 170 species of plants and 200 species of animals
in the forest. Thirteen of the animals were in the Vietnam Red Data Book. They
include an Indian python, oriental rat snake, otter and golden-coin turtle.  
Nhung pointed out a replica of the tents the Communist forces used.

We went on and saw a few small buildings made of the forest trees. Nhung said
these had been replicated the guerrillas houses, health centre and meeting
room.  
In front of each structure was an information panel in Vietnamese and English.  
Between the houses are tunnels, fortifications, most of which are still in the
same shape as they used to be.  
Some wide spots along the channel were bomb craters, Nhung said.  
A document at Xáº»o QuÃ­t Management read, â€˜Around Xáº»o QuÃ­t base were
more than 10 military posts of the allied, US-backed South Vietnam troops,
creating a closed circle. The nearest military post was just 1 km from Xáº»o
QuÃ­t and the farthest was 6 km away.â€™  
Among the documents, it was also recorded that the Communist guerrillas in the
area had survived thanks to the support of food, weapons and medical supplies
from the ordinary people living in the area.

Nhung said, â€˜During the war, the Communist guerrillas and officials also
used boats like this to move from place to place to exchange information and
transport food.â€™  
She said Xáº»o QuÃ­t Tourist Area received dozens of groups of visitors from
other countries, including France, Japan, Russia, China, Taiwan, the United
States and the United Kingdom, every day. Many of the visitors were US
veterans of the Vietnam War.  
 **Getting there:**  
From Saigon, visitors can take National Highway 1 A through Long An and Tien
Giang Provinces. About 1 km from the famous My Thuan Bridge, turn right into
National Road 30 and go to My Long Crossroads at Km13, turn right and go 6 km
to Xáº»o QuÃ­t.  
Alternatively, go to the Mien Tay Bus Station, in Ho Chi Minh City, and take
the Saigon-Cao Lanh bus, get off at My Long Crossroads and take a motorcycle
taxi (xe Ã´m) to go to Xáº»o QuÃ­t.  
Xáº»o QuÃ­t Tourist Area is open from 8 a.m. till 5 p.m.  
The area has a restaurant that serves specialities of Dong Thap, like
tortoises, snakes, fish and mice.

11/20/2019,Petting a duck in ‘Chinatown’,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/petting-a-duck-in-chinatown/,,Text and photos by John Russack,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC00015.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/ban-do-cho-lon.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC00091.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06504.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06486.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06475.jpg,"_(No.8, Vol.2, August 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

Though Saigon is firmly planted on the tourist trail, its neighbourhood wards
connected to the road less travelled capture my imagination with uniqueness
mercifully undisturbed by holidaymakers. With the cover story in the June 17,
2012, edition of the Viet Nam News boldly proclaiming, â€˜Chinatown has for
years faced a lack of space for pedestrians, green areas and parking lots and
had poor services, all of which does not attract tourists,â€™ I sensed an
opportunity. My translation of this less than glowing endorsement is a city
quarter awaiting discovery and most likely exuding raw grit best savoured now
before progress sweeps away the last vestiges of authenticity.  
Chinatown. The very name evokes images of dragon-adorned, red-and-gold
friendship gates serving as the stereotypical portals to dim sum parlours,
souvenir shops and wet markets packed with exotic smells and sounds. These
clichÃ©s danced around my head as my taxi recklessly careened its way towards
Saigonâ€™s Chá»£ Lá»›n (â€˜Big Marketâ€™) neighbourhood. This old quarter, in
District 5 and adjoining areas of District 6, sprawls along a waterway, the
Kinh Tau Hu, that leads east to a canal that meets the Saigon River.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC00015.jpg)  
Lucky cats on Hai Thuong Lan Ong Street

Though firecrackers and beating drums behind any such gate would not meet my
arrival, I did seem to cross an invisible frontier where Nguyá»…n TrÃ£i Street
begins its multilane promenade into Chá»£ Lá»›n. Chinese symbols now
identifying shops alongside their Vietnamese translations change the very
fabric of the city from the bold, colourful, and bright showplace rising
skyward in District 1 to that of a more working-class, subdued aura.
Chinatownâ€™s mid-rise buildings lining a patchwork of narrow streets and
cramped alleyways stand seemingly oblivious to, yet highly weathered by,
timeâ€™s forward march.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/ban-do-cho-lon.jpg)

The taxi deposited me at the centre of this neighbourhoodâ€™s universe, BÃ¬nh
TÃ¢y Market. As I surveyed its jam-packed and malodorous contents sizzling and
baking in the steamy, late morning air, a jaded sense of been there, done that
sent me on a path of quiet defeat. Indeed, the same cast of characters and
backdrops plays out similar narratives from one end of Vietnam to the other,
and I was soon wondering if this trip into Chinatown would prove a non-starter
right out of the gate.  
I quickly exited the market and confronted the chaotic streets fencing me in
with an almost impenetrable stream of motorbike traffic buzzing through what I
at the time deemed to be a most non-Chinese of Chinatowns. I would later learn
a Chinese minority had indeed settled in the area during the late 1700s, but
the subsequent centuries would usurp any superficial and easily noticeable
vestiges of the original culture and language.  
As several â€˜What if?sâ€™ clouded my view, I began losing sight of the forest
for the trees as I fomented a wish list for the area in my mind. What if that
fetid miasma choking Hang Bang Canal and its trash-strewn banks were sanitised
and landscaped into a pedestrian-friendly promenade? What if the dilapidated
apartment houses were torn down and replaced with sleek historical
architecture? What if bright-red lanterns were strung across the streets as in
proper Chinatowns across the globe?

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC00091.jpg)  
Old houses on Tran Hung Dao Street. Dried sausages hanging at the corner of
Nguyen Trai and Phung Hung Streets

North of the market at the corner of Háº£i ThÆ°á»£ng LÃ£n Ã”ng and PhÃ¹ng
HÆ°ng Streets, an elderly woman sporting a most pronounced hunched back and
pushing a squeaky cart overloaded with feather dusters, rain ponchos and other
random odds and ends snapped me back to reality. A man selling bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ bÃ²
lÃ¡ lá»‘t, or baguettes with beef-stuffed betel leaves, from his bicycle-
mounted grill then stopped me dead in my tracks. The charred meatâ€™s sweet
aroma pulled me into the present tense right as this wizened woman inquired
into my potential need for a green plastic fly-swatter firmly gripped by her
knobby fingers.  
I realised then and there I needed to cease this wishing of Chá»£ Lá»›n into
what it could be and dive into what it already was. A guidebook destination
packed with a full dayâ€™s itinerary of must-see monuments Chinatown it is
not, but rather an outdoor museum of everyday life randomly unfolding at its
natural, unscripted pace. The art of travel opens our eyes to keenly observing
the very people whom we largely ignore back home. Indeed, merchants adding
their colourful brushstrokes of commerce to this chaotic canvas called Vietnam
never cease to excite me, and I vowed then and there to become an active
participant in Chá»£ Lá»›n rather than a detached observer.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06504.jpg)

Walking around the area in isolated anonymity was providing only a one-
dimensional toe-dip into these murky waters. I still had yet to develop any
solid connection or clarity as to what Chá»£ Lá»›n was. By joining the growing
queue at that banh mi stand to sample a neighbourhood specialty, I waded in
earnest into the shallow end of this teeming pool. Unfortunately, the
sandwichâ€™s licorice-like betel leaf and anchovy-tasting fish mint herb
washed over my tongue like a bitter tidal wave. Even the oddly textured,
squishy meat left me wondering if I could ever develop a liking for this
particular sandwich. Chá»£ Lá»›n so far remained much the same, as nothing
special had yet emerged from its rough-around-the-edge depths.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06486.jpg)  
Open air street market on Phung Hung Street

I nipped at the fringes of both sandwich and neighbourhood, each subsequent
bite taming the banh miâ€™s initial strangeness just as each step forward on
Háº£i ThÆ°á»£ng LÃ£n Ã”ng slowly brought me in synch with the
neighbourhoodâ€™s rhythm. Friendly shopkeepers waving hello and passers-by
greeting my presence with curious stares helped integrate my presence into
their world. Clusters of paper lanterns hanging in front of shops even infused
a bit of that je ne sais quoi so missing from my original perceptions.  
My anonymity finally slipped away with a giant splash much to the ire of a
woman squatting over her wicker basket of rambutans just across from the banh
mi stand. To say traffic heeds the rules and regulations would be a gross
exaggeration, and a renegade motorbike barrelled towards me on the sidewalk.
Since I had wrongfully assumed that concrete strip between buildings and
roadway is the domain of pedestrians, I engaged the driver in a battle of the
wills.  
Unfortunately the rambutan display lost when my left foot sideswiped the
neatly arranged pyramid as I leapt to safety. The surrounding air inhaled
about four dozen of the spiky red orbs before forcefully expelling them in a
cloud of red. Trying to help the elderly woman clean the aftermath just
brought on hand-waiving and further rapid-fire scolding. I negotiated a
VND200,000 cash settlement and vanished into the crowds.  
Slot-canyon-like Tong Duy Tan Street linking Háº£i ThÆ°á»£ng LÃ£n Ã”ng and
Tráº§n HÆ°ng Äáº¡o Streets provided sweet respite from the wild, wild west of
the main streets. Here anything and everything needed to embellish a wardrobe
stitches these tiny shops together in one common theme. The noontime sun
beamed a scorching light shaft straight down between buildings whose facades
seem to be losing the battle with gravityâ€™s earthward pull. Strings of
plastic beads and baubles caught this diffusion of light and sparkled against
the backdrop of mildewed and chipped concrete.  
Throngs of women dressed in garishly coloured pyjama ensembles inspected pile
upon pile of glittery rhinestones, silky tassels, plastic buttons and more,
and I stopped to bask in this display of everyday life. In a place where
commerce yields to no one, my six-foot-tall frame managed to fully disrupt the
alleywayâ€™s fungshei by impeding delivery men, motorbikes, and shoppers all
anxious to manoeuvre around me.  
My loitering between one particular merchant and potential customers too timid
to push past me solicited a firm scolding that finally expelled me from this
bastion of cheap bling and into nearby PhÃ¹ng HÆ°ng Street. Identical sacks of
bark, twigs, leaves and branches lined the sidewalks of equally similar
storefronts where a friendly woman at number 180 beckoned me over to her
display of these traditional medicines.  
Learning about another culture by purchasing a small bag of the most
innocuous-looking and least offensive smelling deciduous remains for a mere
VND5,000 seemed at first a smart choice. That is, until the womanâ€™s daughter
wrote the name of this dried leaf, táº£ diá»‡p, on a piece of paper before
miming intense gastric distress with a flourish of both hands over her belly
and then a waving of one hand near her nose while gesturing to her backside.  
The elder of the two rubbed my stomach, shot me a sympathetic look and handed
me my plastic sack of dubious contents. Armed with embarrassment and some
potent eastern medicine, called folium sennae leaf in my Western world, I now
searched for a street-food restaurant not too offensive to my Western
sensibilities. A street market anchored around the intersection of Hung Bang
and PhÃ¹ng HÆ°ng Streets sidetracked me, though. These tent-shaded outdoor
tables heaving under massive displays of meats, fruits and vegetables piqued
my interest in a way indoor BÃ¬nh TÃ¢y had earlier failed.  
As I sloshed through the shoe-wetting effluvia of raw commerce, a woman who
could probably recollect first-hand almost a centuryâ€™s worth of Vietnamese
history gazed my way with a most wary and annoyed look. Had the rambutan woman
alerted her to my clumsy presence? About a dozen of her live white ducks
stewed silently in air infused with the noxious scent of the nearby
fishmongers. Forgetting that ducks in Vietnam are a food source rather than a
zoo display, I began petting one.  
The sales woman suddenly thrust a quacking mass into my startled hands and
began negotiating a price. I now surmise that an unwritten code of the market
dictates that if a potential customer touches the merchandise, said customer
shall purchase the object in question. Now what exactly she expected a camera-
toting western guy to do with a feathered animal I do not know, but there I
was holding this now angry bird at armâ€™s length as it flapped its wings in
dire protest.  
My awkward exit caused even more scrutiny by the locals when I accidentally
kicked a pan of live prawns. Thankfully, I emerged from the market without
further incident at the corner of PhÃ¹ng HÆ°ng and Nguyá»…n TrÃ£i Streets. Two
lanes of busy motorbike traffic were all that separated me from a sidewalk
grill sending copious amounts of oily smoke signals to anyone within a one
block radius and now tugging at my appetite.  
I ordered sÆ°á»n nÆ°á»›ng, or grilled pork chops, and prayed the food under
this sagging awning would fail to summon any immediate need for the táº£
diá»‡p now at the ready for any untimely emergency. Though I was somewhat an
anomaly amongst a decidedly local clientele, I felt a growing connection with
Chá»£ Lá»›n as I downed that pork so deliciously marinated in a sweet honey
sauce and grilled to charred perfection.  
My soul was next to receive a random bout of nourishment from Chinatownâ€™s
streets. Stumbling upon Minh Huong Temple, at 184 Há»“ng BÃ ng Street, very
much by chance brought the good fortune of a visit during the full moon when
ancestor worship rituals peak. Past and present live simultaneously in
Vietnamese culture, and the deceased provide sage advice and guidance to
family members attempting to make sense of the future.  
A steady stream of everyday people including taxi drivers, nurses and police
officers ebbed and flowed around various stations within the ornate temple. A
wooden stick eliciting melodious, gong-like rings from a copper vessel, the
shaking of a cowbell hanging from a life-size, red, cloth steer, and the whir
of electric fans circulating billowing clouds of incense smoke all combined to
overwhelm my senses. A feeling of guilt enveloped me as I suddenly felt more a
voyeur breaking the sanctity of the rituals under way around me than a curious
student.  
After ten minutes of silent observation, I decided to insert myself for the
first time into the spiritual side of Vietnam. In exchange for VND60,000, an
attendant handed me a red coil of incense the width of a large wok. A young
girl explained that I should carefully inscribe the names of my ancestors on
the accompanying red slip of paper. Next a harried man thrust a candle into my
hand and motioned for me to quickly light the coil as I was holding up
progress. He then attached the note bearing the names of my grandparents and
hoisted the smoky offering heavenward to a hook in the templeâ€™s wooden
rafters with a long, specially designed pole.  
On that sombre note, I concluded an amazing day getting to know this enigmatic
neighbourhood. As my taxi slowly manoeuvred through the motorbike traffic on
Nguyá»…n TrÃ£i Street, Chá»£ Lá»›n faded into the surrounding neighbourhoods
until in the passage of one block to the next it was suddenly no more. From my
air-conditioned cocoon I peered through a dirty window and for the first time
all day now saw clearly what drives Chá»£ Lá»›nâ€™s uniqueness. Its unabashed,
unapologetic authenticity and hard-working people are the blood that fuel
Chinatownâ€™s heart.  
Saigonâ€™s Department of Planning and Architecture has formulated an
ambitiously titled plan known as â€˜Ideas for urban design for conservation
and rehabilitation of the Chá»£ Lá»›n Old Quarterâ€™. New houses will be built
in a similar style to historic architecture, billboards limited, adding new
floors to existing buildings prohibited, pedestrian only streets created and
green areas expanded. These lofty projects naturally create concerns amongst
the 68-hectare preservation areaâ€™s 440,000 residents, who worry any rash
redevelopment will forever alter not only the streetscape but their lives as
well.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC06475.jpg)  
Lighting the incense inside Minh Huong Temple

No matter how this neighbourhood evolves, I will forever cherish the mental
snapshots of this incredible day. Now, instead of dreaming about
possibilities, I find myself  
hoping Chá»£ Lá»›n can indeed retain its current identity while potentially
charting a brave new course. Perhaps I shall soon return to Minh Huong Temple
to light another red incense coil to summon the ghosts of Chá»£ Lá»›nâ€™s
past. I will ask them to carefully usher this district into the future in a
manner where the next generation remains closely connected to yesteryear.

11/20/2019,Stylish Novotel links beach with golf and more,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/stylish-novotel-links-beach-with-golf-and-more/,,By Pip de Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Pool-Building-Reflection.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Deluxe-room.jpg,"_(No.7, Vol.2, July 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine,Advertorial)_

When one chooses to stay at international brand name hotel one does so with
the expectation of guarantees of quality and deliverance of a certain set of
services. One expects to eliminate the pot luck element there can be in
staying in a place which is locally run. One downside to this is that the
hotel chosen may lack local flavour and the building and the room in
particular may look as if it has been carbon-copied and could belong anywhere
in the world. Indeed one brand’s advertising campaign backfired a few years
ago when it advertised staying in its rooms was just like being at home. Not
everyone wishes to travel half way around the world to feel like that. A
second objection people have to staying at a famous name place is that there
might be little concern for the local people or economy and particularly in a
poorer country one’s tourist dollar may not be helping to bridge the
inequalities. Novotel is a well established brand that promises you a four-
star experience of international and not just local assurance. As the name
implies, you expect the hotel to be a new building and not a place of
historical interest, so some effort might be required to give it ambience. I
had already stayed in two Novotels before, one in Dalat, Vietnam and the other
in Ypres, Belgium, each of which had both rendered all expected comforts and
displayed local character. I was thus quite excited about the prospect of
staying in my third Novotel in Phan Thiet, and as for the question of
sensitivity toward the local economy, that was one I was going to put before
management in an interview.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Pool-Building-Reflection.jpg)  
Photos: Novotel Phan Thiet

The approach to the Novotel Phan Thiet is grand and one star above
expectations. It is like following the drive to the approach of an English
stately home with woods, the sea and then the Golf Club House on one side and
the course itself with jagged mountains behind on the other. As your bags are
whisked away by bellboys and you enter the lobby with its high fans and hard
wood furnishings your sense of grandeur hightens and you may feel you have
entered a country mansion in which to set an Agatha Christie murder mystery.
On closer inspection you realise you are actually in the Orient as large
ceramic jars are placed against the walls and pillars, in a recess are gilded
wooden statues looking like Vietnam’s famous water puppets and there is a
souvenir shop selling local memorabilia. A little further on there is an open
corridor overlooking gardens decked with wickerwork chairs an area redolent of
the French period in which to take an evening drink or smoke a cigar.  
I did in fact have the opportunity to enjoy a beer and peanuts on this
verandah and in the delightful relaxed company of the duty manager for the
night who also happened to be the executive chef, Mr Jason Lynn, who hails
from New Zealand. We talked about the green credentials of this hotel. It has
internationally recognised certifcation. Only a few years ago even fully
Vietnamese-run hotels were not taking this matter seriously but now it has
become de rigeur. A fellow writer friend of mine was nearly run out of the
country for pointing out that foreign guests are not partial to swimming in
their own sewage. Staff here are regularly involved in beach clean-ups and the
hotel even has a cow called Margaret who patrols the 1.3km beach hoovering up
any bio-degradable waste. I watched out for Maggie in the morning but was told
she had already passed by-an early riser just like the Vietnamese people
themselves. Jason also informed me that the Hotel has a policy of recruiting
locally as fully as possible and praised the people for their natural
friendliness. Food as far as possible is bought from local markets. â€˜Did you
know,â€™ he asked, â€˜Sturgeon is farmed locally now so we can offer
Vietnamese caviar?â€™ The hotel also supports the local initiative to produce
vanilla in this province, even arranging a tour to the experimental farm.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Deluxe-room.jpg)

Our superior room was quite unusual for this part of the world. It had a
parquet floor which for me adds instant Southern European charm and warmth. It
was furnished with a sofa, a see-your-face-in-it polished writing desk,
charming golden bedside lamps and a TV with a full range of channels. There
were tea and coffee-making facilities with a well stocked mini-bar and a full
range of toileteries in the spanking clean bathroom. On the whitewashed wall
there hung a water colour picture of a wooded Vietnamese scene that reflected
the reality of the trees in the gardens below. For me the greatest feature was
its balcony wide enough for two rooms bedecked with comfy chairs and a table.
I sat out there in the evening dreamingly admiring the sea and gardens with a
glass of red Galliac wine in my hand. It was a starry light and with the
lights of the hotel dimmed downwards I was able to point out the
constellations to my daughter, the plough leading us to the North Star, the
swooping shower of The Swan and the Great Bear.  
The breakfast buffet really demonstrated the advantage of selecting a hotel
with international expertise. Knowledge of customer demands and high standards
of training of the friendly and attentive staff were in evidence. Seldom have
I seen such a wide choice and all the western condiments were right at hand.
There was Worcestershire sauce, a few drops of which I do enjoy upon my toast,
Extra Virgin Oil, gourmet vinegars, mustard for the exquisite home-made herby
sausages and even good old British HP sauce. All too often if you ask for such
â€˜exoticaâ€™ at a locally run hotel of this standard you are met with blank
stares. My Vietnamese wife enjoyed her pho breakfast although it took her a
little time to recover from the shock of finding the broth was sweet as is the
southern way of preparing it. She hails from the centre where they prefer it
spiced up with a bit of chili pepper.  
The range of activities on offer leaves you spoilt for choice. There is of
course the championship golf course and management is keen to shed golf of its
elitist image and get a wide range of folk to participate. There is also a
tennis court, a table tennis and games room and a petanque (bowling) rink. The
sea itself usually has wind enough for kite and wind surfing. There are
cooking classes, spa and massage treatments in a beach side pavilion and
biking tours as well excursions arranged to places of interest in the
province. A list of special daily activities is posted in the lift. For the
kids there are supervised activities and a babysitting service. On the morning
of my stay I was up at six and ready for a dip in the two pools, one of which
is oblong shaped with racing lanes marked out, and the other round and more
for straightforward leisure. I popped my head out onto the balcony. What a
scene already! You just can not beat the Vietnamese for early rising. They
were all out there doing their morning exercises and tai chi!  
The Novotel Phan Thiet is a fine choice for business, leisure and family
holidays. It has fine comfortable rooms each with a view and it has truly
international cuisine. It is sensitive to the local people and environment. It
offers far more in activities than just the golf and beach implicit in its
full name and benefiting from being part of a worldwide company it gives tip
top service. With all that it has to offer, most should agree that this hotel
offers exceptional value for money. All in all, it is the perfect place to
chill out, enjoy first class food and beverage and perhaps try out a new hobby
or learn something more about this beautiful country.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/nhin-ra-bien.jpg)

Out on a long spit of land graced with a sandy strand forming the barrier
behind which lies South East Asiaâ€™s largest lagoon you will find one of
Vietnamâ€™s best beach resort hotels. The Ana Mandara is located fifteen
kilometres east of the ancient capital of Hue and much of its architecture and
interior room design is inspired by the opulence of Imperialâ€™s Cityâ€™s
monuments.  
There can be no other city of a quarter of a million souls outside of Vietnam
that possesses no bus system other than Hue. It seems the poorer a place the
fewer buses it has. This extends to a lack of public transport to outlying
villages. I did see one or two bus stop posts but these appeared more for the
purposes of leaning against whilst you watch the girls go by. The Ana Mandara
thus can be difficult to reach. You could do as the locals do and go by
motorbike. I regard this as unsafe and undignified. I refuse to risk life and
limb of myself and family. It comes as a relief to know that the resort does
operate a shuttle bus but it seems to run on demand and they were not coming
in town just to pick up one family. Four wheels good, two wheels bad as the
saying goes. There was no alternative but to hire a taxi for the equivalent of
$10. When you consider you can go the 160 kilometres from Ho Chi Minh City to
Mui Ne in a just as comfortable air conditioned coach for half this price a
tourist might consider saving the beach part of his holiday for there.  
Aside from the minor detail of access once you arrive at Ana Mandara you will
certainly not be disappointed. First appearances count for a lot and the lobby
is truly magnificent. You will feel grander than entering the Hue citadel.
Upon mounting a stone staircase from the top of which water bursts forward in
fountains of urns you enter a wide open hall fit for an emperor. Ahead of you
is a long ornamental infinity pool and beyond that the boundless ocean. What
an entree! Extra kudos are in order as they have thought of the disabled by
incorporating a ramp system.  
A member of staff with good English, Mr Quan, took our bags and led us to our
Beach Front Villa. Fresh fruit and tea making facilities were complimentary
and soon we were partaking of these on the ample verandah. A daisy lawn with a
path leading to the well-manicured beach was in front of us. The room itself
was sumptuous with a four poster bed, black hardwood furniture and cushions
and sofa in royal Hue purple. A cabinet held ceramic jars that looked as if
they had been salvaged from a centuriesâ€™ old wreck. The bathroom redolent of
lemon grass had all manner of toileteries and both an indoor shower and
another in a small garden with high bamboo walls.  
A big plaudit to Ana Mandara â€“ they did not decide to build this resort in
an isolated place in order to gain a captive market. It is right alongside the
fishing township of Thuan An. The advantages of this are manifold. Not only
does it ensure that the fish and seafood on the tables of its two restaurants
(One of which specialises in Hue dishes) are super fresh but it also
contributes to the local economy with employment. A waitress at breakfast
estimated that seventy five per cent of staff were local. Especially as
bicycles are available for free, another advantage for the guest is that one
can experience at ease the life of a Vietnamese fishing community.  
For the first night we decided to dine out in the village and enjoy a stroll
among the friendly local folk. After walking just eight minutes we found a
supermarket with a Vietnamese fast food outlet. My wife and daughter who had
been feasting on â€˜bÃ¡nh bá»™t lá»câ€™ (manioc dumplings stuffed with prawn)
were not hungry. They just enjoyed the Walls ice cream. I had a seafood rice
platter for a mere VND15,000.  
There is plenty to do at the Ana Mandara. Apart from the beach there is a
large pear-shaped swimming pool and a games room. Cookery classes can be
arranged. A large number of excursions can be made through the tour desk. If
you are feeling more adventurous you could use bikes to explore the paddies,
the shrimp and aquaculture farms and maybe hunt for crabs in among the
remaining mangrove patches.  
The thought occurred to me that being exposed to the ocean might be dangerous
in the typhoon season. My wife, who is a Hue person, remembers a terrible
storm some thirty years ago that caused severe damage and loss of life. I
raised this concern with management who assured me that an evacuation plan is

11/20/2019,Trees that grow green tea and their own snow,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/trees-that-grow-green-tea-and-their-own-snow/,,Text and photos by Lam Phong ,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/anh-1.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/MAp-Che-Co-Thu-2.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/anh-2.jpg,"_(No.7, Vol.2, July 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

Well-known tea production areas in Vietnam are Má»™c ChÃ¢u, ThÃ¡i NguyÃªn,
LÃ¢m Äá»“ng and PhÃº Thá», but when it comes to tea trees of hundreds of
years old, the important provinces are on the axis from the northeast to the
northwest such as HÃ Giang, LÃ o Cai, YÃªn BÃ¡i, SÆ¡n La and Äiá»‡n BiÃªn.  
My search for old tea trees was motivated by tales about a tree hundreds of
years old in the HÃ Giang highlands that grows wild and has a white down.
Monkeys are trained to pick this tea, because the job is dangerous for humans.  
The trees are called chÃ¨ (tea) san tuyáº¿t (san â€“ transcription of a
Chinese word which means mountain and tuyáº¿t means snow).  
I started along the mountain range of West Con Linh in HÃ Giang Province. This
province shares its border with China on its northeast side. I was
disappointed to find that some very big plantation tea trees â€“ two or three
people can barely join hands around the trunk â€“ had been cut down, milled
and sold away to China since 2008. The law does not prohibit the felling of
plantation tea trees. There are only trees with trunks 20 cm to 40 cm across
left. According to the tea-growers I have met, tea trees 20 cm across are 60
to 80 years old.

Tea trees in Lao Chai,  
Ha Giang Province in the north-west

Until recent decades, the Dao ethnic groups used to grow tea trees. Above
their doors they used to hang bundles of tea for the treatment of stomach
upset or ailments caused by the weather or miasmas.  
The lowlanders have known about the old san tuyáº¿t tea trees in HÃ Giang
since 1979 when their soldiers went to the frontier to defend the country
against an invading Chinese.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/MAp-Che-Co-Thu-2.jpg)

Mr Ngo Viet Thanh, a tea dealer in HÃ Giang, told me that san tuyáº¿t tea
trees in HÃ Giang grew untended on the highlands above 1,000 metres. The san
tuyáº¿t tea in HÃ Giang has a tart taste when drunk for the first time due to
a high level of tannin, but then the taste becomes pleasantly sweet. â€˜The
ethnic people consider this a gift from the heavens and pick they take it
without having to tend itâ€™, he said.  
Mr Thanh in 1993 he began to be interested san tuyáº¿t tea. He went to hamlets
and villages in the HÃ Giang highlands to bring it to the lowland markets. I
accompanied him to the NhÃ¬u Sang Dao hamlet, in the commune of XÃ­n Cháº£i,
Vá»‹ XuyÃªn District, HÃ Giang Province. It took us more than two hours to go
50 kilometres in a Russian automobile, covering steep, stony and dangerous
tracks along the Vietnam-China border, with precipitous slopes above and
below.  
The old tea trees in NhÃ¬u Sang, close to the Dao houses, have a diameter of
20 cm and more. A dozen kilometres away from NhÃ¬u Sang, where the MÃ´ng Hoa
(Flower Hmong) ethnic group live in Lao Cháº£i, there are tea trees with
trunks that can only just be circled by the arms join clasping hands. Mr Thanh
said â€˜It was hard to transport the tea out because of the tracks full of
obstacles. People picked the tea, dried it in the sun, and sold it to Chinese
merchants. It is a few kilometres from Lao Cháº£i to China.  
I was told that on top of Mount Fansipan, in the HoÃ ng LiÃªn SÆ¡n mountain
range, there were tea trees hundreds of years old.  
Having got through a number of paperwork formalities that required waiting two
days, I had permission to enter HoÃ ng LiÃªn National Park on foot in search
of old tea trees. The path I travelled on there was the one travellers take
for the peak of Mount Fansipan, the highest mountain in Vietnam.  
At an altitude of 2,200 metres, I and my guide came to a fork. On the right a
path led to Fansipanâ€™s top. We took to the left, leading to a ravine. The
guide warned me that the area where the tea trees grew had a warm climate that
favoured several kinds of snakes.  
The first tea tree I found was about a metre in diameter and taller than I
could estimate. It was hard to recognize it as a tea tree because the whole
area was dark green, every root covered with a lush, green moss. Under the
canopy was a fern forest. Although I had seen several old tea trees, I had
never seen such lofty and big ones. The trunks were close to each other and
covered with a white mould. This made the tea trees very different from the
other kinds of trees in the area. The guide told me that from the altitude of
2,200 metres up to 2,800 metres, there were old tea trees everywhere and the
higher we got the smaller and shorter they would be.  
There was no sign that the tea trees here had been exploited, as they had in
the other areas. I know of no study or data on this area of old tea trees. I
picked a few leaves and brought them back to camp to brew. The tea was light
green. It had a strong, fine, sweet taste that lingered.  
Through the Vietnam Tea Association, I met Mr Phan Trong Nhat, 34, who had
been more than 15 years in the tea business in the city of Äiá»‡n BiÃªn
Phá»§, Äiá»‡n BiÃªn Province, in the northwest, and was the only big buyer of
tea in the provinceâ€™s Tá»§a ChÃ¹a district.  
Mr Nhat agreed to guide me to the tea area in a small truck. The piece of
careful advice he gave me was, â€˜You have not been able to figure out how
dangerous the track is. I have driven everywhere in the northwest region, and
I would refuse to go to Tá»§a ChÃ¹a.â€™ The distance was but 260 kilometres,
and it would take a whole day. He advised me to get everything ready: tents,
camp beds and hammocks, rice cookers and rice, as there would no services.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/anh-2.jpg)  
Tea trees in Hau Chua, Tua Chua District,  
Dien Bien Province in the north-west

The road from Äiá»‡n BiÃªn to Tuáº§n GiÃ¡o was fairly smooth, but before we
reached Huoi Long the track was muddy, due to heavy rain the previous night.
We passed by the ravines covered with the clouds and terraced rice fields.  
We took turns to get off the truck to push. Two tires had to be changed. We
reached Tá»§a ChÃ¹a as it got dark, 11 hours after we had set out, both
covered with mud and dirt. We spent the night at Táº£ SÃ¬n ThÃ ng, and started
for XÃ­n Cháº£i next morning.  
The Hâ€™mong in XÃ­n Cháº£i Commune have a forest of the big and beautiful tea
trees. Next morning we left the truck behind and got on three Win motorbikes,
so-called â€˜motor baggage horsesâ€™ of the jungle.  
Mountains appeared and disappeared in mist. The highlands were rough with
rocks and the green of young maizes plants. We were moving into a wonderland.
Mr Nhat told me that, according to the Department of Agriculture in the
District of Tá»§a ChÃ¹a, the trees grew in four communes, Táº£ PhÃ¬nh, SÃ­nh
PhÃ¬nh, Táº£ SÃ¬n ThÃ ng and XÃ­n Cháº£i. The communes with the most tea trees
were Táº£ SÃ¬n ThÃ ng and XÃ­n Cháº£i, which between them had about 7,000,
4,000 exploited.  
We were stopped by a big bamboo branch. Mr Nhat said, â€˜The track ends
here.â€™ Looking around, we realised we were in a forest of old tea trees in
clouds. We were in a mountain hamlet called Háº¥u Chua. Two people stretching
their arms around the trunks could hardly reach each other. The trees were
about ten metres high, with fat buds and strong, thick, glaringly green
leaves.  
Mr Nhat said these trees were the most productive in Tá»§a ChÃ¹a, as they grew
at a high altitude, with mountain clouds covering them all day. They were
vigorous and did not need care.  
In the grove belonging to Hang A Chu, in Háº¥u Chua mountain village, there is
the biggest tea tree in Tá»§a ChÃ¹a. Three people stretching their arms around
its trunk can barely touch hands. A Chuâ€™s grand-father had said trees in the
garden had been there eight human generations.â€™  
In Háº¥u Chua village, almost every house has at least two or three tea trees
growing close to the verandha. Hang A Chu said, â€˜There were so many tea
trees in our Hau Chua area. In 1982, when I came back from military duty, I
found the people in the hamlet had cut down two-thirds of the tea trees so
that they could have more land to grow potatoes and cassava.â€™ A Chu had to
stop them, telling them that if they ran out of rice, they would still have
tea trees to live on and that he would like to buy their trees if they wanted
to sell them.  
We kept on to Mang Chieng village, also in XÃ­n Cháº£i, hoping to get into the
tea-tree grove of Thao A Cua to see a tea tree that had been selected as the
most beautiful in the area, with a big trunk, nice branches and well-
proportioned, like a perfect bonsai. Thao A Cua said, â€˜Nobody knows who grew
this tea tree; when I grew up I saw it there, then we just went ahead and
picked its leaves; nobody has to take care of it.â€™ Thao A Cua said he picked
three or four times a year, each time basketting as much as 20 kilograms. The
house of Thao A Cua is classified the biggest in the hamlet. Thao A Cua said,
â€˜It is thanks to these tea trees that I own this personal estate.â€™  
Mr Nhat told us that he had asked several people in the area to install a
dryer in the hamlet, given them technical guidance and pushed them to pick and
dry leaves he would come every week or every month to buy and then take back
to sell to tourists in Äiá»‡n BiÃªn.  
Mr Nhat said he was the only tea dealer in this area.

‘Where you go? I help you,â€™ the man reclined atop his motorbike called out.
As I shuffled by, his cries reached even higher levels of urgency as he
realised his two wheeled limousine service likely was no match for my
immediate transportation needs. â€˜Sir! Sir! I help you find. Where you go?â€™
His pleas washed over me and stopped me in my tracks. The truth is I knew not
where I was headed on foot much less what would unfold here in the Truc Bach
Lake neighbourhood of Hanoi.  
Soon enough his solicitations and inquiries faded into the background
cacophony of motorbikes, beeping horns, and construction noise. At the time I
could never have predicted that one morning of aimless wandering would become
a collection of experiences forever changing me. Indeed, the journey can at
times prove more interesting than the destination itself.  
I recently returned to this beguiling city that had once upon a time captured
my heart while hosting me for eighteen months. While living in the nationâ€™s
capital, my universe largely centred around the Western-friendly Tay Ho
enclave, on the shores of its namesake lake, along with sporadic trips into
the energetic Old Quarter. Sandwiched in between is Ba Dinh Districtâ€™s
concrete sprawl of bustling streets and alleyways seemingly off the radar of
visitors and expats alike with Truc Bach Lake but one of many diverse anchors.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/img002.jpg)

Busy Au Co Road, largely detached from the labyrinth of streets flanking the
eastern edge of this expanse, stands mired in its traffic-clogged six-lane
glory. Every manner of wheeled conveyance ever known to grace Vietnamese
pavement, along with a brave pedestrian or two, whizzes past in its haste to
quickly close the gap between distant points, only to miss a more people-
scaled neighbourhood stirring to life one narrow shop house at a time. In
contrast, the slow pace of my own two feet allowed me to drink in a perpetual
bombardment of scenes so different from any in my normal daily routine.  
Approaching this small lake, that is fragrant in a most interesting way,
ringed by typical urban sprawl, one cannot help but notice two very distinct
cityscapes colliding in only a few short blocks. Yen Phu Road deposits
visitors from more upscale Tay Ho with its tony residences and shops into the
more local Truc Bach area where the two competing cultures swirl together with
a mix of restaurants catering to both populations. Then, in the blink of an
eye, each disperses into its own local rhythm depending which direction one
chooses. This particular morning the road less traveled by my fellow
Westerners beckoned, and I immersed myself full on into old Vietnam.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC08995.jpg)

The ribbet, ribbet, ribbet of frogs faintly emanating through green metal
window shutters drawn tight snapped me out of everyday lifeâ€™s homogeneity to
suddenly transport me into a new world anything but. Their croaky melody
conveyed aural insight, or warning depending on oneâ€™s tastes, of the menu
dâ€™jour at one of many hot-pot restaurants dotting the lake. Our senses
swallow the world around us in so many ways, and already a feast of sound
attempted to monopolise centre stage.  
Midrise buildings in varying states of repair from multicoloured canyons
channel the curious down narrow streets into a version of Vietnam well beyond
any guidebookâ€™s black and white pages. Cooking fires roaring to life with
the whoosh of a match, television sets well past their prime belting out their
tinny effect, wicker brooms scraping noisily against dusty concrete – the
morning rhythm varies little day by day.  
One partially open gate luring my eyes into a very basic room illuminated by a
single bulb dangling from bare wire served as my portal into a more private
domain. I spied a multi-generational family converting overnight living
quarters to a more economic day use as young children rolled up sleeping mats
while adults rolled out food carts and assorted cooking accoutrement. A wall
calendar depicting rice terraces carved into a mountain remained in May 2002.
Perhaps its unturned pages are a metaphor for life in this neighbourhood as a
whole, where deep-rooted tradition seems to change slowly, and tomorrow shall
fade much as yesterday descended into its gradual close.  
The narrow sidewalks already abuzz with sunrise rejuvenation pulled my
attention back into the humid morning air. As I turned the corner at Quan
Thanh and Dang Dung Streets, I paused to watch motorbike-riding patrons
bargaining with sidewalk vendors for meat and vegetables. An opening hour of a
different nature loomed imminent as shopkeepers and office workers slid open
squeaky gates, turned on lights and gently swept these morning squatters from
doorways further towards the road.

A sidewalk breakfast feast.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC08975.jpg)  
Fresh rice noodles inside the market

Soon a whole different facet of these environs would spring to life with
commerce of a more modern ilk awakening from its nightly slumber at
preordained opening hours posted on window glass. Such conformity blends so
seamlessly into the more time-honoured ways undisturbed by the tick-tock
regularity of the clock.  
What a wonderful sensory overload Hanoi can be, I thought to myself as an
automated cash machine dispensed from my account an ocean away. A simple blue
plastic card had accessed an invisible universe probably foreign and unknown
to the conical-hat-wearing saleswoman hovering protectively over pig ears and
snouts lining a blue plastic tarp just steps away.  
Just as this neighbourhoodâ€™s hustle seemed unable to absorb any further
bustle, strategically placed loudspeakers suddenly crackled to life with a
melodic female voice reciting the dayâ€™s announcements and news. For me these
indecipherable words seemed exotic icing on an already delicious multi-layered
cake, yet for many this invisible woman is one regular link to the outside
world beyond the end of the block. As the mystery woman bid her final
goodbyes, the sultry morning air swooped in to replace her with a heavy-handed
warm embrace as I neared a particularly vibrant strip of Chau Long Street.  
The Chau Long Market seems to redefine the meaning of summertime torridness
while sizzling and baking all who venture inside its run-down walls defying
the pull of gravity along its namesake street. Streams of effluent darkening
tables of raw meats and seafood slowly trickle earthward to wash over damp
concrete already stained with a long history of runoff. Small electric fans
swirl the odour of commerce upward where the awaiting heat and humidity
disperse the malodorous air outward.  
No matter what may be on offer at a particular vendorâ€™s slice of real
estate, one constant permeates all corners of the market – the chop, chop,
chop of cleaver meeting wooden cutting block. Chop, chop, chop. Chop, chop
chop. As I dodged throngs of shoppers negotiating the narrow passageways,
sensory overload once again encroached on my personal space. I felt as if I
had been sucked into a tornado with no idea where my journey in its roaring
funnel would deposit me. Chop, chop, chop. Chop, chop, chop.  
The sounds around me rose to fever pitch, and I had failed to hear a woman
beeping her motorbike horn at me. The last thing one would expect inside a
building is a motorbike, yet the marketâ€™s impossibly narrow passageways seem
to host a steady stream of exhaust-spewing traffic. A wizened old woman
wearing the patterned pyjama ensemble serving as the loud and colourful
uniform for many a Hanoian grabbed me by the arm to extract me to safety.
Though her words were just a string of rising and falling tones to my
untrained ears, their intent rang loud and clear. She was admonishing me for
loitering in a place yielding to no one, and I felt the tsk, tsk, tsk of
others who had witnessed me upset the natural balance of their market
universe.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC09032.jpg)

In a respectfully discreet manner, I followed my rescuer from a distance while
she nimbly manoeuvred from table to table probably as has been her ritual
spanning many a decade. As she collected a small amount of an unidentifiable
red meat and plastic bags of vegetables and herbs, I wondered about the time
journey her eyes have witnessed. For now her market ritual seems to withstand
the test of time in sharp contrast to the glass and steel skyscrapers
sprouting around her.  
Just beyond Chau Long Market on the short Ngu Xa Street bridge, the off-key
notes of a funeral band rising ever so faintly above the normal neighbourhood
din reminded me that every era at some point shall draw to an end. Down a
narrow side alley stood a bright white tent in stark contrast to the darkening
mass of storm clouds now drowning out the late morning light. Perhaps what I
next witnessed is a clichÃ© of epic proportions yet in a way sums of the
Vietnam swirling about Truc Bachâ€™s streetscape.  
Rolling steel-coloured clouds finally unleashing their opening shot forced me
to duck under a pho parlourâ€™s leaky awning. As I listened to millions of
raindrops pounding their drumbeat into the concrete and tin around me, a gust
of wind peeled back the tentâ€™s door to reveal the old guard laying to rest
one of their own. A young mother with baby in arms emerged from the funeral
and quickly walked past my vantage point. As always in the cycle of life,
darkness gives way to light with the sunâ€™s healing rays once again
brightening the void left by the slackening rains. These fleeting images of
the cycle of life colour in this perpetual painting one brushstroke at a time.  
As Truc Bach reawakened from this brief rain-fuelled siesta, I wound my way
out of its tantalising tentacles. Where Pho Duc Chinh Street meets the hulking
Sofitel Hotel, which looms larger than life over its more friendly-sized
neighbours, an elderly woman pushed her rusty bicycle out of an alley. She
mounted a torn seat and wobbly manoeuvred past three young, fruit-smoothie-
sipping women fully engrossed in a parallel electronic world delivered via
their smartphone screens.  
Seconds later an equally withered man pedalled by on his bike while a speaker
attached to the crooked handlebars blared banh bao, banh bao, banh bao to
indicate that a transparent case attached behind his seat secreted a stash of
steamed buns. No one seemed to notice anyone else.  
This belongs to the juxtaposition that is the beauty of Hanoi, where old and
new collide so abruptly, like distinct brushstrokes on a constantly evolving
canvas. By the end of my walk I had created a masterpiece that was part
traditional Michelangelo, part abstract Matisse. The ever-changing arrangement
of characters and scenes ensures the streets and sidewalks of Truc Bach Lake
are thankfully never the same painting twice.

11/20/2019,Vietnamese culture and more set in a Garden of Eden,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/vietnamese-culture-and-more-set-in-a-garden-of-eden/,,By Pip De Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_%200322---Le-Belhamy-resor.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1205171006-Le-belhamy-resor.jpg,"_(No.6, Vol.2, June 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine, Advertorial)_

Things had changed a lot since my last visit in 1999. Back then my hair was
brown and the tourists were mostly young backpackers. Now they were mostly
retirees and greyer even than I now am. This time being with a guide I had a
greater appreciation of the former international port made famous by Japanese,
Chinese, Portuguese and other European trading nations only to be supplanted
by nearby Danang. Demographics having changed, there is now less demand for
partying in town and staying in small inns after a hard day’s look at the
museum city of Hoi An. The market has responded to this change and I should
like to introduce you to an idyllic garden retreat resort with its own beach
facing the Cham archipelago just seven kilometres to the north of the hustle
and bustle. In spite of its location, this is a place which, with its
artefacts and quaint paintings, never lets you forget you are in an area of
great cultural and historic interest.  
The moment you drive through the gates and see a multitude of coconut palms
set among bright flowering bushes you realise this is a place of great beauty
created by a landscape gardener of distinction. It is so large in fact that a
shuttle buggy is needed to transport you to your room or villa. The moment you
enter reception with its tropical hardwood pillars and beams, and which is in
fact an ancient community hall transplanted from a village in the north of the
country, you realise that Vietnamese heritage is a notable feature of this
place. As I checked in front office manager Mr Nhan explained they had another
of these historic buildings in which the library is housed. Visiting it later
I discovered with its open sides it is an ideal place to sit, read and watch
the kids in the play area in front of it. In addition there is a 200-year-old
wooden church saved from an uncertain fate which now serves as the resortâ€™s
Vietnamese restaurant. A further cultural feature to be found both indoors and
dotted around the gardens are the replica terra cotta statues of Cham gods and
apsaras (dancing girls). I took the opportunity to enquire about the meaning
of the resort’s name. â€œâ€˜A play on wordsâ€™, said Mr Nhan, â€˜bel amiâ€™ is
French for good friend while the beach here is called â€˜Ha Myâ€™.â€  
Soon I was whisked off to my villa designed in traditional Vietnamese style
with a red tiled roof and dark wooden interior with beams and high rafters. It
was very similar to my sister-in-lawâ€™s in the Phan Thiet countryside except
that this was kitted out with every creature comfort imaginable. There was a
wide four poster bed, a wide screen TV, a beautiful curved bathtub and walk in
shower as well as a well stocked mini fridge, coffee and tea making facility
and on a side table a bowl of complimentary tropical fruit. On the walls there
hang a series of prints of idyllic scenes from ancient Hoi An City. Outside in
the high walled garden was quite a sizable swimming pool for my own private
use. As if this was not enough one of the resortâ€™s two large swimming pools
was just outside the garden gate and a few steps beyond that the pristine
hawker free beach.  
After relaxing a while, chomping on the freshest pineapple and papaya and a
quick dip in the pool I was taken on a tour of the villas by Mr Nhan. In
addition to the Vietnamese design there are others of Japanese and Chinese
architecture and interior design. The latter are arranged along a canal
crossed by several arched bridges reminding one of the Grand Canal. Some are
designed for couples. Others with an upstairs and downstairs could house a
family or two couples. The largest villas with their own access to the beach
can accommodate up to six adults.  
I ate only French food although as I mentioned already Vietnamese fare is of
course on offer too. It was so tasty that I asked to meet the chef to
compliment him or her. I was a little surprised when I was introduced to a
young Vietnamese woman in her mid 20s. For lunch I had tomato soup with bread
rolls and butter for an entree. This was followed by seafood pasta with a
mixed salad of black olives, tomato and lettuce on the same large platter.
Last came a mouth watering tiramisu in a long glass, a layered dessert of ice
cream with sifted cocoa powder on top and cake and biscuit. Delicious enough
as it is, if I were making it I would take a tip from the English trifle
recipe and add a dash of sherry to the cake layer.  
At dinner there were more diners as guests had returned from sightseeing. I
should tell you that the resort has a regular shuttle bus service into town.
This time it was a mixed vegetable soup followed by a seafood rice dish close
to a Spanish paella but with ordinary rather than saffron rice. It consisted
of clams in their shells, chicken, pork and squid and was so filling that I
only had room for the traditional Vietnamese fruit dessert.  
I ate my meals in the company of the owners, Monsieur Georges Guignon and his
wife Kim Vinh. Georgesâ€™ parents were French and Vietnamese. Georges and Kim
designed the interiors of the Victoria Hotel chain in Vietnam notably in Phan
Thiet, Sapa and Can Tho before creating Le Belhamy. Amazingly Georges says
they did it all themselves â€“ the architecture, the interiors and the gardens
and pools. â€˜Ahâ€™ he sighed, â€˜C’Ã©tait le travail du Titanâ€™, adding
â€˜but once I started I could not finish.â€™ Titanic work it may have been but
luckily they did not run into any icebergs. We and some of the staff spoke
mostly French that weekend giving me the chance to upgrade my rusty knowledge
of that language.  
There is a tennis court at the Le Belhamy and I would have liked to have shot
a few aces across its netting but unfortunately my body is just not toned up
for such activity, and I feared a sprained ankle or the agony of a pulled
muscle. So I opted for the more appropriate alternative, namely a trip to the
on site spa. I underwent the one hour Le Belhamy signature massage and came
away feeling like a new man though not quite ready to take on Federer. This
was a very methodical massage with 15 minutes spent on working on and around
each limb. Apart from the massage parlour all the usual services of a
â€˜spaâ€™ are on offer including steam bath and sauna.

The morning of departure came all too soon. After a large buffet breakfast of
international and Vietnamese fare I found myself being driven in the hotelâ€™s
limousine to Danang Airport in the company of manager and tour guide French
speaking Mr Son, who pointed out places of interest on the way, war graves,
the old American air base Non NÆ°á»›c beach and the Marble Mountains. Mr Son
spoke impeccable French and his youthful plans to study at the Sorbonne I was
to learn had been thwarted only by the onset of war. I had had the best of all
worlds at Le Belhamy, history, art and architecture, botanical gardens, beach
pool and bodily rejuvenation. Now it was back to return to the rigours of a
hard daily work routine in Saigon but at least with the comforting thought
that I now know where to find Eden when I need her.

There was a time not so long ago when anyone choosing to fly into Vietnam had
the choice of either Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi airports. These days when I am
asked by people thinking of coming to visit the country for the first time
what their port of entry should be, in particular if they do not have the time
to discover the whole country, I do not hesitate to advise them to hit the
target at the centre and fly to Danang. When I first flew into here around 13
years ago the only international flight was from Bangkok, now it is well
connected with all the countries in the region and there are even flights
direct from European Russia.  
I went there this May and it had been a few years since my last visit. As soon
as I entered the brand new airport terminal building upon disembarking from my
flight from Ho Chi Minh City it became evident that somehow the city has made
herself attractive to investors and is fast becoming the â€˜Dubaiâ€™ of the
country. There are new bridges spanning the Han River. High-rise offices
blocks have been erected making this a city of two river banks. Famous
international hotel chains have built their palaces here already and there is
a sporting complex area with stadia of daring architecture which makes one
wonder if Danang is about to put in a bid for the Olympic Games.  
Yet the fundamentals remain the same. Everything Vietnam has to offer is easy
to find here. There is history and heritage nearby in the ancient capital of
Hue and the erstwhile international port of Hoi An. Unlike the two main cities
of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City where you have to drive for hours to find a
decent beach, Danang has its bay and corniche. There are hill stations in its
mountainous backdrop and the Unesco heritage site of My Son. The renowned Cham
Museum in the city itself gives you the background to this major world
civilisation which, perhaps on a par with the Egyptians or Mayans, had its
centre in the area. The Sa Huynh culture that precedes it is featured in a
small museum in Hoi An. There is even a dive centre on the Cham archipelago.  
Should you choose to explore this area allow me to introduce to you two
wonderful places at which to stay and relax that I have recently had the
pleasure to sample each, with its own private gardens and beaches.

NgÃ² gai, ngÃ² gai.â€™ Sounds incomprehensible to my ears floated around me,
but that they were directed at me never entered my consciousness. â€˜NgÃ² gai!
ngÃ² gai!â€™ The words became louder, and finally a wizened old woman grabbed
a bushel of cilantro (coriander) with her knobby fingers and shoved it
abruptly under my nose while repeating â€˜ngÃ² gaiâ€™ once again. Her
unexpected gesture caught me woefully off guard, and I initially jumped as the
intoxicating aroma first filled my nostrils and then my imagination. More than
a few housewives chuckled and pointed my way as embarrassment flushed my
cheeks a shade of crimson probably only matched by the overripe tomatoes piled
around my feet.  
One by one these seasoned veterans of street market shopping held up various
herbs for me to sniff, and soon enough my shyness melted away as our laughter
merged into one sidewalk chorus under the blazing sun. For the first time I
truly felt a part of my neighbourhood as they repeated the Vietnamese names
for these bushels of greens while encouraging me to parrot their tongue-
twisting words. Welcome to a side of Saigon well off the beaten path for most
visitors and expats, yet so close for those who dare shake off their
inhibitions and immerse full-on into the chaotic maelstrom.  
HCMCâ€™s Binh Thanh District sprawls in its low-rise concrete glory just
beyond the confines of high-rise apartment compounds such as The Manor and
Saigon Pearl. The transition from these westernized cocoons into the fabric of
Binh Thanhâ€™s streets and markets is rather abrupt. The short journey down a
narrow alley just beside The Manor is much like a portal transporting me to
what I affectionately call â€˜Old Asiaâ€™ as I leave behind my familiar world
of American fast food outlets, rooftop swimming pools, and modern
supermarkets. Sadly I feel most of my neighbours remain firmly ensconced
within our modern confines as their only journey through Binh Thanh seems to
be a taxicab ride from the lobby door to points onward.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07864-By-John-Russack.jpg)

Though the skyline now reaches upward with these blocks of concrete and glass,
thankfully the way of life in my surrounding neighbourhood remains grounded
and has yet to synch up with District 1â€™s more sanitized environs. Downtown
may have the Bitexco Tower showcasing a new and revitalized Vietnam emerging
on the world stage, but Binh Thanh and other outer districts still allow us to
savour vestiges of traditional Vietnam in its authentic, unspoiled state.  
One could describe a city as a living, breathing organism with its
neighbourhoods the pulse. Binh Thanhâ€™s crowded narrow streets and impossibly
narrower alleyways lead us into Vietnamâ€™s rapidly beating heart. Here in
Binh Thanh, the market along Vo Duy Ninh Street radiates its energy outward
from the packed shops and the ever changing parade of street vendors who keep
the ambience fresh and lively. Women in conical hats peddling their wares, old
men in pyjamas playing checkers, and the tired taking a noontime siesta all
vie for their piece of the sidewalk as minutes turn into hours and hours
lazily meld into another day.  
I think I speak for many a westerner who visits a Vietnamese street market for
the first time with only our orderly shops and manicured streets back home as
a frame of reference. Raw meats hanging from hooks and piles of unidentifiable
animal innards shock us into submission. Mounds of tropical fruits and leafy
greens tempt us while the hustle and bustle of regular people going about
their daily lives captivates us. We use our cameras and smartphones to
document our fascination, and modern technology so incongruous with these
â€˜old schoolâ€™ surroundings allows us to instantaneously dispatch images to
our curious friends and family back home.  
A walk down Vo Du Ninh leaves no doubt in our minds that we have crossed a
frontier, though less defined is the boundary between store and sidewalk.
Indeed, anything and everything needed to sustain a neighbourhoodâ€™s basic
needs is on offer here, and the displays of clothing, dry goods, and foods
occupy both building and pavement. This overflowing bounty pushes pedestrians
into the roadway where a constant stream of motorbikes greets the wary who
dare maneuver amongst the two-wheeled madness.  
Just when my senses on one recent visit strained to absorb any more overload
of suspect smells wafting from trays of curious meats, music from CD vendors,
and motorbike horns of impatient drivers, a crack of thunder swooped down into
the market much like a conductorâ€™s baton directing a symphony. If only for a
split second, Binh Thanhâ€™s medley of instruments fell silent. Soon enough
though, life carried on with the orchestra rising once again to ever higher
levels of fevered pitch. The rains came and murky rivulets rinsed away the
superficial hubris, yet no amount of falling water could ever wash away the
deep soul secreted behind the bricks and mortar.  
Through luck I have caught fleeting glimpses here and there of these private
lives. Binh Thanh is the young woman in her hair salon kneeling before an
altar adorned with incense, candles and food offerings to loved ones deceased.
An open window becomes a portal through which the intoxicating smells of home
cooking waft down into the humid still air cloaking the alleyways. A rusty
gate slides open to reveal two young children huddled in front of a flat
screen television beaming American cartoons into a spartan living room while
their father reads a newspaper. This family scene transports me back to my own
childhood and causes me to see first hand people are people no matter where we
are.  
To say food fuels daily life in this neighbourhood is an understatement, and
many of my mornings wandering through the market begin with a hearty yet
inexpensive breakfast served up sidewalk dining style as only Vietnam can dish
up. The choices in one short block are plentiful â€¦ soft bÃ¡nh khá»t
pancakes with tender shrimp at their golden turmeric-tinted centres, rich
bowls of reddish bÃºn bÃ² Huáº¿, and cups of warmed tofu with piping hot
ginger sauce. With my expanding waistline as testament to the
neighbourhoodâ€™s bounty, Iâ€™ve settled on bÃºn thá»‹t nÆ°á»›ng as my
favourite street food delicacy.  
At first my elderly breakfast hostess seemed thoroughly perplexed a Western
man would grace her tiny food stand for a bowl of silky rice vermicelli topped
with marinated grilled pork and pickled carrots. Iâ€™ve noticed she rewards my
continued patronage with ever increasing portion sizes and the most savoury of
meats from her battered charcoal grill. Weâ€™ve shared many a conversation
indecipherable to each other yet somehow I think our imaginations fill in the
blanks and we walk away somehow mutually understanding each other.  
My delicious slide into this street market culture began in earnest with a few
pieces of tropical fruit every now and then acting as a gateway to the
unknown. Fresh herbs and vegetables came along next to seduce me further into
the marketâ€™s tentacles. Mounting confidence has finally led me to actually
buy live prawns and other seafood right from a vendor set up next to buckets
of congealed pig blood and pans of chicken feet so foreign to my culinary
tastes honed on a Western diet.  
While the market sustains a community, for me it nourishes my fascination with
a world I once upon a time never knew existed. This is definitely the Vietnam
we dream of from afar, and the journey can prove unnerving for the newly
initiated. Our bearings become easily lost in the sensory onslaught as we
wander around the alleyways, yet fear not. All we need is a quick glance up,
and the towers of The Manor rise like beacons pulling us back towards our
everyday lives so unlike the gritty surroundings.  
What seems such an exotic underbelly to a westerner such as me is real life
for millions of our neighbours. While we may never be able to actually walk a
mile in their shoes to fully understand their lives, we can venture into their
world and gain a new appreciation for this side of the city right at our
doorstep. I am thankful to now have a foot firmly planted in both worlds.

I let fall a drop of fish sauce into my cup of black coffee, a culinary trick
not widely known outside of PhÃº Quá»‘c island, the home of the most special
fish sauce of Vietnam. I was sitting on the veranda of Mr Nguyen Huy Hoangâ€™s
family home. A light breeze blew from the harbour. The companyâ€™s four
fishing boats were docked, waiting for the moon to tell the fishermen when to
put to sea. I was surrounded by a rich variety of bird song from dozens of
birds indigenous to this island southwest of Vietnam, kept in decorative cages
all through the garden, and by roosters calling all afternoon long. At my feet
were four half-sleeping PhÃº Quá»‘c dogs with their distinctive whorls on
their backs. Sitting opposite me was an 84-year-old woman, Madam Nguyen Thi
Thanh Xuan, who founded the famous Thanh Ha Fish Sauce Company together with
her husband. She was preparing for the afternoon meal, and telling me about
her life on the island, about the days when her husband and she had to work
hard to raise their nine children, relying on the traditional occupation of
making fish sauce to take care of them all. She told me about the several
times her fish-sauce facility had been burned down during the war, about the
times she had risked her life supplying food for her husband and his VC
[Vietnamese Communist] comrades, who had escaped into the forests to fight
against American and South Vietnamese Army forces. Madam Xuan also told me
about the struggles and hardships she had endured in reviving the methods of
making PhÃº Quá»‘c fish sauce after the war. I was sitting in front of a woman
who had lived most of her life for fish sauce, which she loved like her own
flesh and blood.  
Fish sauce are two words strange to most Americans but most familiar to me.
They have haunted me during the past 43 years. I became devoted to fish sauce
while I was a soldier in Quang Tri, at the 1st Air Cavalry, during the
American War in Vietnam. A group of South Vietnamese Regime soldiers once
shared a meal with me on a base camp called Evans, 35 kilometres north of Hue,
and introduced me to Central Vietnamâ€™s version of this ancient sauce. After
returning to America, I even tried making my own version at home, much to the
dismay of my neighbours, who called the police, complaining of a terrible
â€˜death smellâ€™ coming from somewhere in the neighbourhood. I had to explain
that the only â€˜bodiesâ€™ were those of the fish that I was allowing to
ferment behind my fatherâ€™s garage in the summer heat. The police made me
promise to get rid of the stink and left.  
I imagined I would have to endure the stink of fish sauce in the making once
more when I set foot on to the kingdom of fish sauce, PhÃº Quá»‘c. However,
much to my surprise, the whole island was radiating a sweet and attractive
fish-sauce perfume when I came out of my airplane at the PhÃº Quá»‘c airport.  
For some years, I have been able to buy PhÃº Quá»‘c fish sauce from
supermarkets and Asian markets in America. A half-litre or one-litre bottle is
amazingly cheap. On PhÃº Quá»‘c, I come to realise that each drop of fish
sauce is as valuable as gold. It glitters with the labour of the fishermen,
who spend days drifting across the sea to catch the best long-jawed anchovies
â€“ the only type of fish used for making PhÃº Quá»‘c fish sauce. A long time
ago, these anchovies were abundant around PhÃº Quá»‘c, and fishermen did not
have to travel far. However, the supply had now diminished, and the fishermen
had to go out at least a hundred kilometres, embarking on risks and high seas,
to be able to catch the tastiest fish, and preserve them during their
transportation back to the dock to make the purest fish sauce. Going on board
Thanh Haâ€™s fleet, I had the opportunity to talk to the fishermen, who warmly
told me about their use of lights to bring the fish to the surface during
nights without moonlight, the skill of using large nets and preserving the
fish immediately. I was surprised to find out that these fishing boats were
very clean and did not smell at all. The salt was carefully prepared before
each voyage, which lasted from one to five days. Strict hygiene was followed
during the catching and transportation, and when the fish were unloaded, the
boats were washed and scrubbed.  
The nets, 600-700 m long and 75 m deep, are inspected for holes that can be
caused by bigger fish and strong currents. Menders quietly repair them under
parachute-like tents in the hot sun. In the tropical heat, I see drops of
sweat glitter. The women work diligently and swiftly. They happily invited me
to lunch, served right at the net-mending spot, and it was delicious, with
salad, stewed pork and fish sauce. It was even more delicious because of their
interesting stories and their laughter. I learned that many of these women had
come here from the mainland, and were able to support their families with the
net-mending job and other work in fish-sauce-making. I realised that the
traditional PhÃº Quá»‘c fish-sauce industry was sustaining their lives and
providing opportunities for many Vietnamese families.  
Visiting the fish sauce factories in PhÃº Quá»‘c, I also realised my method of
many years ago had been ridiculous. Instead of letting the fish ferment on
sticks to drain into a cooking pan like I had, the traditional PhÃº Quá»‘c
fish sauce is fermented in golden wooden barrels. These huge barrels are 1.5
to 3 metres wide and 2 to 4 metres tall. One barrel can contain 7 to 13 tonnes
of fish. Following the 200-year-old tradition of making fish sauce on PhÃº
Quá»‘c, only wooden barrels are used to ferment the fish. These barrels are
cleverly assembled by hand in PhÃº Quá»‘c, using bá»i lá»i trees, vÃªn vÃªn,
or chai trees (as it is harder and harder to find bá»i lá»i trees these
days). The staves that form the body of the barrel are held not by hoops of
steel but twine made from PhÃº Quá»‘c rattan. The barrels do not leak, and can
last 60 and sometimes 100 years.

My own method of making fish sauce was to cook the fish slowly for a long time
until the fermented fish becomes completely liquefied, put the liquid through
a fine strainer and then cook it slowly again until the colour is like that of
the sun the moment before it sets into a distant horizon. The traditional PhÃº
Quá»‘c fish sauce is made completely via natural fermentation. When the boat
docks, the salted fish (called chÆ°á»£p in Vietnamese), are transferred into
the barrels. After each barrel is filled, a thick layer of salt covers the
surface and fermentation begins. A barrel of salted fish needs a year to 18
months to â€˜ripenâ€™ (chÃ­n). During this time, the fish need to undergo
several stages; most importantly stages when their juices are drawn from the
barrel and pumped back into it continuously, to encourage the breakdown of the
flesh and increase the protein level in the liquid. After this juice meets
protein, smell and colour standards, it is bottled in PhÃº Quá»‘c or
transferred to Ho Chi Minh City, where it is bottled and distributed globally.  
Madam Nguyen Thi Nguyet Ha, director of Thanh Ha Company, told me that before
he died, her father had got her to promise to maintain the tradition of fish-
sauce-making and never to compromise it because of greed, money or the demands
of the marketplace. Madam Ha and her brother have kept this promise, and their
mother told me that the fish sauce made these days was better than it had ever
been. She told me that fish sauce was not only used for cooking, but had
medical properties. Buried deep in the ground for months, fish sauce became
the very dark máº¯m lÃº. Many famous singers of Vietnam had come to PhÃº
Quá»‘c to look for her and asked her for máº¯m lÃº, to soothe and bring back
to life tired and strained voices.  
There was a breeze off the ocean but it would not cool things down much. This
was a tropical island and the temperature rarely cooled down enough for most
Americans to be comfortable.  
I donâ€™t know whose dreams I dreamed last night, but I donâ€™t think they
were mine, for how peaceful they were and how they carried me away on a dark
river into some kind of strangely familiar place. I was sitting at a table
with Vietnamese friends in a lovely garden. Vietnamese seemed to flow out of
my mouth as if I were as fluent as a native speaker, and although the table
was set with a wonderful meal, all accented with a variety of types of fish
sauce, instead of eating, we all seemed to be talking at once. Then the dream
changed and we were all singing songs in Vietnamese that celebrated the sea
and what it gave to the people who lived there and how it sustained their
lives. Flowers and birdsong were everywhere. I could see the boats rock in the
harbour, and hear the quiet voices of the women who repaired the nets.  
Then I was awake, and in the real garden with my new friends. They didnâ€™t
mind that I had been an American soldier in the Vietnam War. Perhaps not so
amazingly, a strong friendship between an American veteran and a Viá»‡t Cá»™ng
family has been established partly because of our common love for fish sauce.  
Madam Nguyen Ha joked with me that if I had met her father more than 40 years
ago, for sure I would not have been visited by the police, and my own personal
fish sauce would not have stunk so badly, but rather, radiated the sweet
perfume of the sea. Achieving success after a very difficult childhood where
she had had to live inside a factory full of fish-sauce barrels, and been
mocked by school friends because, they said, her white school uniform
(Vietnamese Ã¡o dÃ i) always smelled of fish sauce, she talked very
passionately and proudly about her family traditions of fish-sauce-making. Her
eyes shone the light of a strong belief: that the values of the traditional
PhÃº Quá»‘c fish sauce would be preserved and developed sustainably.  
I was now in another world, so different from my own. I felt I did belong to
this world â€“ one that allowed all my senses and feelings to come alive. I
watched the handsome grandson of Madam Nguyen Thi Thanh Xuan play with a bird
whistle that he filled with water and then made sing. The birds in the garden
began to sing the song of goodbye, too. But goodbye is not good enough a word
here, so I instead I said â€˜See you again,â€™ as I was certain that I would
come back, together with many friends, to the kingdom of fish sauce.

**This is the second and final part of  
John Russackâ€™s day on Phu Quoc.  
The first part is in the May edition.  
**  
Within a kilometre of the market, the landscape changed most abruptly from
bustling town to largely deserted beaches along a narrow, red-dirt road. Near
Cá»­a Cáº¡n Beach, the road curved out of a forest into the beach where
suddenly a most suspect odour pervaded the thick air. I stopped to inspect
long strips of black cloth stretched along the road half in the dusty roadway
and half in the grass. What seemed like thousands of tiny grey fish atop this
plastic net soaked in the sunâ€™s rays to transform their bodies into edible
yet fragrant cÃ¡ kho, or dried fish. Only an hour prior had women selling this
pungent treat in the market crossed my path, and here I had unexpectedly
rolled up on the source.  
The sound of ocean waves swept in to fill the void left behind as I killed the
motorbikeâ€™s rough engine. Two conical-hat-wearing women glanced curiously
over at me, and I felt almost like a voyeur peering through a window into a
forbidden world. For the first time that morning I truly felt like a foreigner
so out of place amongst the local people. I smiled and called out â€˜xin chÃ
oâ€™, which was met much to my surprise with their own Xin chÃ os and friendly
hand-waves.  
I took their kind gestures as an invitation to more closely examine their
work, and before I knew it was crouched down next to them on a large plastic
sheet. They held up fish for me to inspect and engaged me in a conversation I
could not follow by words but could understand in spirit. For about five
minutes I worked alongside them much to their delight. This truly is
backbreaking work, and these women toil tirelessly under that relentless sun
while shrouded in heat-soaked clothes. They may never realize it but they gave
me new respect for the field labourers who feed this nation.  
As I walked back to the road a silver motorbike flew by in a cloud of kicked
up dust and a Western couple veered recklessly into the grass to alight at the
nearby beach. In their haste to find sun and sand, they had missed an
experience with these women so unlike anything found in our Western worlds. I
realize we all have different agendas on Phu Quoc, but the local people have
such interesting stories to tell. Even if their words seem wholly
indecipherable to my English-hearing ears, their message somehow is still
fully understood.  
The young couple now taking a dip in the blue waters is a prime example of how
holidaymakers descend upon Phu Quoc to harvest the sunâ€™s power in an effort
to knock away the wintertime blues. Just steps away locals such as the fish
women use the very same sun as fuel for their labours. These two worlds
seemingly collide within steps of each other with neither world paying much
attention to the other.  
Newly energised to seek even more Phu Quoc off the beaten path, I set out on
roads going from rough to worse. In this area north of Cá»­a Cáº¡n my
motorbike met its match on one particularly rocky stretch of red dirt. As
destiny would have it, my tire blow out happened right in front of a woman and
her elderly mother who appeared to be the only civilization as far as I could
see. They rushed up to me and excitedly pointed to their home about 100 metres
distant. What are the chances of breaking down right in front of a tire shop
in the remotest of remote areas?  
If a flat tire is the cost of admission to an experience I will never forget,
I hope flattened rubber once again graces a future journey. For such a
traditional island, I must admit my surprise that a woman had a background in
mechanics and the Midas touch to bring my motorbike back to life. This just
goes to show we cannot be so quick to stereotype since reality so many times
will turn our assumptions upside down.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC08898---Phu-Quoc-from-ai.jpg)

As this young womanâ€™s grease-stained hands healed my battered motorbike, her
mother motioned me into one of two dusty green hammocks hanging in the open-
air room. She took her place next to me and we lazily rocked back and forth in
the languid afternoon heat exchanging pleasantries. She spoke to me in
Vietnamese and I in English yet somehow we had a mutually intelligible
conversation complete with laughter. Perhaps we both used our imaginations to
fill in the blanks and build up a story in our minds. Her repeated offers of
iced coffee and beer showed genuine hospitality from the heart and that this
pit stop lasted only 30 minutes was my only disappointment.  
I had heard the horror stories of travellers before me who had spent upwards
of VND300,000 for tire-repair, and I will admit to fully expecting a similar
rip-off. Much to my surprise and delight my bill came to a more reasonable
VND90,000 price tag and I almost felt guilty paying so little for a service
that in the West would empty our wallets so much more. I felt more guilty for
assuming the worst though, and this brief stop taught me so much about how we
must check our preconceived notions and keep an open mind.  
Whiling away the time in a hammock is one of those experiences a guidebook
could never list. I realised that having a flat tire turned out to be some of
the best luck I could have as I had collected the perfect addition to my
growing list of quintessential Phu Quoc experiences. I think this is the first
time a flat tire has become one of the highlights of a journey, and this woman
and her mother epitomise the good that we forget abounds in our world. We
exchanged goodbyes and away I went to explore deeper into Phu Quocâ€™s
interior near GÃ nh Dáº§u.  
After completing a large sunburned loop around the northern half of the
island, the narrow roads eventually deposit the dusty and wary on the main
â€˜highwayâ€™ sucking all wheeled conveyances right back into centrally
located DÆ°Æ¡ng ÄÃ´ng town. With lunchtime fast approaching and hoping to
avoid the tourist friendly lunch spots over at nearby Long Beach, I drove
around for twenty minutes on the hunt for a suitable lunch spot to refuel
before trekking onward to points south. My criteria were simple: a tolerable
level of authenticity, largely identifiable meats in the serving trays and a
decent crowd in this sweltering heat-bath of a town no one could ever accuse
of being the least bit Western.  
Tucked away near the airport at 59 Hung Vuong Street is an open-air concrete-
block structure housing the Tuyen Duy restaurant miraculously matching my
peculiar list of standards. Itâ€™s funny how I am becoming a street-food snob.
If a business I regularly frequent tastes good enough, all sorts of violations
to my western sensibilities will not bother me in the least. If I do not know
the place, as was the case this day, the exact same surroundings scare me into
ten minutes of worrying whether I should dive in or not.  
Just pausing out on the sidewalk a few minutes to mentally weigh the pros and
cons of eating here caused quite the commotion inside, and three family
members rushed out to persuade me I had indeed struck gold with their food.
One young girl kept shouting, â€˜pig, pig, pig, pigâ€™ over and over again
while pointing at me. I chuckled to myself that perhaps I was the subject of
her shouts rather than a pork product on offer in the silver serving pans.  
She yelled â€˜pig, pig, pigâ€™ some more while tugging on my sleeve and her
sister excitedly ladled stir-fried pork and shrimp on to a generous mountain
of steamed rice. My mere presence was enough to start the ball rolling on a
lunch order I had not yet even verbally placed. Evidently Westerners are not
part of the normal lunch repertoire, and everyone seemed genuinely excited to
have me dine in their midst. Calls of â€˜Where you from?â€™ and â€˜Where you
go?â€™ filled the stagnant humid air as people tested their English skills on
me.  
And yes, I was excited, too about the flavour of my VND20,000 meal. If only I
knew enough Vietnamese to inquire into the recipe, as the marinade was a
perfect combination of sweet sugar and salty fish sauce along with hints of
ginger and pepper. Contrary to many tough meats on the mainland, this â€˜pig,
pig, pigâ€™ was tender and paired perfectly with pink shrimp so soft inside
their crunchy, paper-thin shells.  
The jar of fish sauce on the table inspired my next stop on this tour of Phu
Quoc off the beaten path. As I drove back through the outskirts of town
looking for an exit to points south, the smell of aged fish suddenly permeated
the humidity. The malodorous air grew stronger and stronger as I approached
what appeared to be a factory producing this liquid so integral to the
Vietnamese kitchen. One whiff of this brown water is enough to strike fear in
to all but the most intrepid palates. What is it about fish sauce that scares
us so badly? Is it the odour or just simply the name? I know we Westerners are
not so keen on strong smells or anything fermented in giant barrels as our
tastes seem to run a bit more on the subtle side.  
Rows of large wooden vats at Thinh Phat brandâ€™s facility impart a vapour
trail that must be experienced first hand to be believed. A ladder against one
of these fragrant reservoirs beckons the curious upward and this short trip is
not for the faint of heart. Thousands of litres of fermenting fish water
stewing in the languid air caused me to momentarily rethink my love for this
liquid gold. Ten minutes of this self-guided tour poking around the various
stages of production about tapped out my stamina against the noxious
surroundings.  
I will admit once upon a time the very thought of fish sauce had left me a
skeptic, but now, much to my delight, this staple of Vietnamese cuisine has
opened my eyes to food experiences well beyond my formerly sheltered tastes.
This â€˜nÆ°á»›c máº¯mâ€™ is a metaphor for Vietnam. Just as with the factory,
first impressions can overwhelm the newly initiated and cause us to recoil in
fear. Getting to know this brashness eventually tames its overwhelming powers,
and we can dig under the surface to see it for what it is . . bold, brash, and
full of flavour. Giving something new a chance can prove a sensory-packed
addition to our lives much like this journey into Phu Quoc barely six hours
old at this point.  
Just down the road from Thinh Phat is another component to Vietnamese cooking
on the opposite end of the taste spectrum from fish sauce. Rows of pepper
trees line small farms, and if we are lucky we may even spy a wizened woman
sorting out the berries to dry. As with the fish earlier in the morning,
curiosity got the better of me at one such plantation. A conical hat lifted to
reveal a warm smile and the elderly woman held out a bushel for me to inspect.
She had me repeat â€˜tiÃªuâ€™ over and over again until I could pronounce this
word for pepper like a local pro.  
Once I graduated from this language lesson to her satisfaction, my reward was
a sample of her labours. She motioned for me to eat a green berry the size of
a pea, and its acrid bite washed over my tongue. Perhaps we can look at her
offering as an olive branch between tourist and local. I may not be able to
walk a mile in her shoes nor can she probably even begin to comprehend my
world, but for a few fleeting seconds we looked into each otherâ€™s eyes and
gained an acceptance of each other.  
Eventually even the road less travelled emerges from the shrouds of dust and
uncertainty to merge with the world more known to us. Earlier I had met a
German couple interested in sampling island delights of a seafood kind, and we
had formalised plans for dinner. Just as the last reddish hues of the sunset
disappeared into the darkening horizon, we aimed our motorbikes towards the
Night Market in DÆ°Æ¡ng ÄÃ´ng on the quest to sample Phu Quocâ€™s ocean
bounty.  
This strip of very basic restaurants comes to life after dark along a jam-
packed pedestrian zone dedicated to the tourist trade. Imagine tarp-covered
open-air food stands with display tables of every seafood these waters could
ever think about producing. My new friends and I randomly chose a crowded shop
called â€˜Sand Foodâ€™, and the English-speaking owner, Mr Quyen, guided us
through his freshest of fresh selections. I swear he could make a seafood-
lover out of anyone with his unabashed enthusiasm for ocean treats.  
Within minutes our mountain of seafood sizzled atop a smoking charcoal grill,
and sent our hunger pains into high gear. Tuna kebabs with pineapple, carrots,
eggplant and a sweet marinade; sea urchin with peanuts and seasoned oil; spicy
grilled tuna fillets; plain calamari. That was my smorgasbord. The sea urchin
proved one of the more unusual choices of the evening, and the thin black
layer of meat smacking of the ocean inside the spiny shell took me on a taste
journey I had never before experienced. I liked the urchin well enough to
order two more and proved that even here in a largely tourist market a taste
off the beaten path can be had. All this gut-stuffing goodness plus a 333
brand beer cost less than $10 per person.  
Yes, Phu Quocâ€™s Night Market is firmly planted on the tourist trail. Itâ€™s
overrun by the sunburned masses. Itâ€™s really not a â€˜localâ€™ experience at
all, with its English menus and sanitised surroundings. My friends and I waxed
enthusiastically about this place and dinner proved an amazing end to a
colourful day. I would travel back to Phu Quoc just to sample the far-from-
run-of-the-mill Night Market again. Itâ€™s really that good, inexpensive and
fresh.  
With over 175 kilometres logged on mostly back roads, three delicious meals
and a souvenir sunburn to boot, I can now proclaim Phu Quoc is more than just
a destination to me. I now see Vietnam in a different light and am forever
changed. The most random of strangers touched my life in so many different
ways they cannot even imagine, and I wonder if perhaps I did the same for
them. The American poet and author Maya Angelou once observed, â€˜Perhaps
travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry,
laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and
understand each other, we may even become friends.â€™ I wholeheartedly agree
now after sharing a day with everyday people and in the process becoming
friends with Phu Quoc. Rather than a photo album of guidebook-sanctioned
places so many visitors before me have seen as well, I come away with a
reinvigorated soul filled anew with colourful memories unique only to me and
the people with whom I crossed paths.

11/20/2019,Grand dame with new wing,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/grand-dame-with-new-wing/,,By Pip de Rouvray,,"http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/2-Jan,-2011-take-from-camer.jpg","_(No.5, Vol.2 May 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

The Grand was a popular name for a hotel during European colonialisation of
much of the world. I remember being shown pictures from our family album of a
stay when I was just a baby at the Grand Hotel, Singapore. I returned as an
adult only to find the grand dame in a dilapidated state on the outside and
the interior a wreck. She had not seen any guests for a long while. I am happy
to report that the Grand Hotel, Saigon, has escaped such a fate. She has lost
none of her grandeur. On the contrary she has recently acquired a new wing
which keeps in conformity with her original design so well that you would
hardly notice the join. In spite of Vietnamâ€™s having regained its
independence long ago, the Frenchness of this hostelry is well preserved, with
European-style pictures adorning its walls and French popular song playing in
the background. The high standards of the French culinary tradition also still
prevail here.  
One thing that might surprise you and give many a reason to pop into the Grand
is that it has a wonderful collection of paintings on its walls, perhaps
second only to the Art Museum. They all have a French flavour. The first one
that might strike the guest is a large one of how the hotel might have looked
when it first opened its doors, in 1930. The others on view on the ground
floor are all of the hotel in its leafy avenue surroundings and are in a post-
impressionist style. They all appear to be of the thirties but look carefully
and you will spot one with the Bitexco tower, Saigonâ€™s tallest building,
which was only completed just over a year ago. In the second floor restaurant
there are many still-life pictures. The walls of the twentieth-floor Grand
Cafe have a more modern-art flavour, with bright colours predominating. Most
of the exhibits appeared to be original oil paintings but the Renoirs on the
third floor of the new wing were obviously not. They are accompanied by
paintings of Italian buildings and scenery and are likely to catch the eye of
many a city businessman as they are outside the conference and banquet halls.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/2-Jan,-2011-take-from-camer.jpg)  
**The expanded Grand Hotel romances steam and the Saigon River in paintings.  
**  
All this I saw on my tour of the old and new â€˜Grandâ€™ conducted by sales
manager Miss Ho Ngoc Loan. We mounted the wonderful sweeping staircase with
its gilded wrought iron balustrades and took a look at the new Saigon Palace
restaurant on the second floor. It is spacious with a capacity for around two
hundred. It offers international cuisine but at the time of my visit it was
being used for breakfast buffet only. The grand opening was slated for 15
April so it will be ready for your enjoyment when this article gets to your
hands. Also on this floor is the Eden Rock bar, despite its name a quiet and
relaxing lounge in which to entertain your guests. If itâ€™s views your are
after then take your meetings to the top and twentieth floor. From here a
wonderful urban scape is there for one and all to enjoy. Some of the
neighbouring skyscrapers may block the way a little but you can see a lot of
the river right up to and beyond the recently constructed Phu My bridge.
Turning inward to the city side, the facade of the old French Cathedral looks
a picture as it is uncannily framed by the tower blocks of the Sheraton and
Caravelle Hotels. Snacks and drinks are served on the terrace. If it is wet
and windy, as it was when I was there, the Grand Cafe has an indoor section
and even a private room for small gatherings.  
All this activity was whetting up an appetite. It came as some relief when
Miss Loan uttered the magic words â€˜have lunchâ€™. Soon we were seated at
â€˜Chez Nousâ€™ restaurant. With its whitewashed walls and candelabras, it is
well known, as it is alongside Ngo Duc Ke Street on the ground level. The
internationally known Vietnamese Elvis Phuong was to be heard crooning French
pop standards in the background: yet another Gallic touch to the â€˜Grandâ€™
experience. I am happy to be able to give a wide report on what is available
here, as Miss Loan ordered Vietnamese dishes while I went for a classic three-
course Western meal.  
First to arrive at the table was the mocktail I had ordered, the intriguingly
named â€˜Love Valleyâ€™. This refreshing and creamy drink consists of
strawberry, guava, yoghurt and milk. At VND129,000++ I thought it a bit pricey
but liked it so much that I shall be making it at home.  
For an entree I had the goulash soup at VND100,000++ (that classic dish of
beef and paprika popular not only in its native Hungary but much of the rest
of Central Europe and Germany. After all the fiery chilli peppers my Central
Vietnamese wife uses at home it was a pleasant change to be trying a sweet-
pepper-flavoured soup. I was however a little taken aback to see instead of
croutons a whole crust of garlic bread in the dish. This nevertheless took
nothing away from my enjoyment of a favourite food I had long been missing.
Miss Loan paced me with sÃºp bÃ o ngÆ° or abalone soup. We had both started
well.  
On to the main course. I chose a steak medium-grilled and I am pleased to tell
you it came the way I like it, as one large, thick oval. All too often when
you order steak these days, particularly at those places with any pretension
of being French, it comes as a rather small, round lump drowned out with sweet
sauces. The sauce here was an unobtrusive gravy enriched by the blood from the
tender meat. Furthermore, and a real treat only available in a country such as
Vietnam, which is a top world producer, it came with fresh green peppercorns
on top. The steaks here are American prime cuts T-bone at VND590,000++, rib-
eye at VND490,000++ and strip loin at VND390,000++. I had the latter, which,
on returning home and comparing US and UK charts for cutting beef, I found to
be not exactly the same as but would be classified as sirloin in Britain.
Carnivores please note that from Tuesdays to Sundays there is a buffet BBQ
with all these steaks and more. It costs VND890,000++ inclusive of a free flow
of house wine and soft drinks as well as salad and dessert bars. Let me here
add that Miss Loanâ€™s choice of the Vietnamese dish, gá»i bÃ², a salad with
strips of dried beef, also looked tasty.  
We rounded off things with lemon and chocolate cheesecake (VND120,000++) with
Miss Loan not resisting temptation and diverting from the normal Vietnamese
way of finishing a meal with tropical fruits. I had had a very satisfactory
lunch in good surroundings and fine company.

11/20/2019,The lure of the wild tô l?n,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/the-lure-of-the-wild-to-ln/,,Text and pictures by John Russack,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07944-Large.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07948-Large-CROPPED.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07937-Large-CROPPED.jpg,"_(No.5, Vol.2 May 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

The black and white pages of my guidebook just did not seem to capture the
magical combination of blue water and rolling green hills visible from my
window seat as the airplane lowered its flight path across Phu Quocâ€™s wave-
splashed coastline. Thousands of words offer their helpful insight as to the
best pizza, the largest Western-style sandwich, and bars with the most fellow
travellers. Is this really, though, the Vietnam we dream of from afar?  
We humans seem to be largely creatures of habit, even while travelling. We
journey to the ends of the earth only to carve out a tiny corner of home. I do
understand this desire to seek familiarity when all around us seems so chaotic
and unknown. The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson even observed,
â€˜There are no foreign lands. It is the traveller only who is foreign.â€™
Though his words originated in a century long past, their message remains as
timely as ever. Air travel and the Internet continue to shrink the globe and
in the process create more â€˜foreignersâ€™ among us seeking this guidebook-
approved safety in numbers.  
A banking left turn to join the final approach course into the beachfront
airport caught a picture-perfect view of tiny fishing boats dozens in number,
and this snapshot of the real Phu Quoc inspired me to unearth a side of the
island beyond any guidebook pages. My challenge simply became one perfect day
under the sun journeying deep into the more local side of this green,
mountainous paradise with no agenda, no preplanned route, and no carefully
organised list of must-see stops. I shoved my book deep into my backpack where
I vowed it would remain secreted for the remainder of this trip.  
As my taxi carried me from the airport terminal into directly adjacent DÆ°Æ¡ng
ÄÃ´ng town, the hustle and bustle of this gritty, true-life Vietnamese locale
immediately captured my imagination. My excitement proved short-lived, though,
as English-language signs suddenly sprouting along the four-lane road
announced our entry into the safe confines of a tourist area whose amenities
ameliorate any sense we indeed are foreign. The majority of the islandâ€™s
growing tourist trade centres around this highway in Long Beach, just south of
DÆ°Æ¡ng ÄÃ´ng. A visitor could easily occupy a week safely sequestered from
the â€˜realâ€™ Phu Quoc in this strip of Western-oriented hotels, bars and
restaurants.

**This is part of the authorâ€™s day to remember on the island of Phu Quoc in
southwestern Vietnam. Part 2 will complete the adventure in the June edition**

Travelling is such a personal experience, sending us down our individual
paths, yet guidebooks and tourist maps virtually ensure our journeys shall
cross with those of our fellow travellers all on these same preordained
routes. For some, such a cookie-cutter itinerary is a fine choice, yet I yearn
for a Vietnam not so readily accessible to the average tourist. My philosophy
for travel is simple. I wish to collect once-in-a-lifetime experiences rather
than working my way down a list of the well known monuments. Surely this
version of Phu Quoc off the beaten path must lurk within easy reach if only we
open our eyes and minds.  
  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07944-Large.jpg)  
**This and the following market pictures were taken in DÆ°Æ¡ng ÄÃ´ng, the
main town on Phu Quoc  
**  
Securing a motorbike for the day was my first matter of business at the front
desk of Cá»™i Nguá»“n Hotel, where VND150,000 rented 24 hours of two-wheeled
freedom to hit the hidden byways crisscrossing Phu Quoc. Leaving the
familiarity and safety of Long Beach behind to forge my own course without a
roadmap seemed at first quite unnerving, and I constantly reminded myself this
was an island, so how lost could one possible become? A quick stop at the gas
station to top off the empty tank for the adventure ahead left me realising my
stomach was running on empty as well. I carefully manoeuvered through DÆ°Æ¡ng
ÄÃ´ngâ€™s patchwork of streets scouting out a restaurant not too much a shock
to my Western sensibilities yet at the same time far removed from any typical
Western experience.  
My aimless wanderings up and down the sleepy streets already baking under the
early-morning sun finally paid off with a restaurant well off the guidebook
circuit. All roads in DÆ°Æ¡ng ÄÃ´ng seemingly lead to one single food I had
read fuels the nation, phá»Ÿ. Of course, steaming broth laden with silky rice
noodles and meat are not uniquely Phu Quoc, yet I felt a bowl of research was
in order to sample how other regions of Vietnam prepared this quintessential
dish. Sampling this most Vietnamese of soups seemed proper inspiration as well
for a day of uncovering the most local of experiences.  
Phá»Ÿ SÃ i GÃ²n at 31 Duong 34/4 charmed me with its very basic curb appeal
and complete lack of fellow Westerners. A bubbling cauldron of red liquid by
the entrance swept a fragrant beef aroma across the sidewalk and beckoned me
inward. Patrons hunched over their meals at the metal tables packing the
interior of this fan-cooled shop threw curious glances at my passage down the
narrow aisle. Within seconds their loud slurps and the clink of spoons on
porcelain resumed, to fill the stuffy air, and my presence caused nary a
stare.  
I never could have predicted a simple bowl of soup found anywhere in Vietnam
would commence a chain of events nourishing not only my appetite but my soul
as well. A basic menu of three items matched actual names and prices to the
various scents and cauldrons all around, and the hungry could exchange
VND35,000 for a bowl of â€˜phá»Ÿ tÃ´ lá»›nâ€™. The menuâ€™s English
translation indicated I had ordered a large soup yet lacked any indication
from which animal â€˜tÃ´ lá»›nâ€™ derived.  
As I pondered what sort of taste sensation breakfast held in store, the
middle-aged woman who had just seconds before shouted my order to a hidden
kitchen area suddenly lit several incense sticks while crouching before an
altar. The pungent odour instantly enveloping my table transported me to
another world if only for a few fleeting moments. She sent prayers heavenward
with several head-bobs seemingly of interest to my curiosity only. As quickly
as this impromptu ritual had begun, the object of my stares jumped right back
into her work without missing a beat. I continued staring at this mesmerizing
shrine adorned with blinking red lights and surrounded by dragon fruit,
cigarettes and bottled water, offerings to people long passed.  
  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC07948-Large-CROPPED.jpg)

I had not even noticed the phá»Ÿ now steaming in front of me until an elderly
gentleman laid his wrinkled hand on my shoulder. He startled me back to
reality while mumbling and pointing to the herb basket resting next to my
soup. Within a few seconds several more people had crowded around my table to
school me in the intricacies of proper herbal soup-enhancement. With my white
porcelain bowl now seasoned to their satisfaction with cumin-like, rice-paddy
herb, lemony coriander, basil, tongue-searing chillies and sour lime, they
nodded with encouragement as my spoon lifted the flavour-packed liquid to my
mouth. A young woman asked repeatedly, â€˜Good? Good? Good?â€™ The words
â€˜tastyâ€™ and â€˜deliciousâ€™ are indeed clichÃ©s but what two other words
could one possibly use to describe the intoxicating flavours steeping in that
bowl?  
Along with random and surprising glimpses into Vietnamese culture and
hospitality, this open-front concrete shop house serves a praiseworthy phá»Ÿ
full of deep beef flavour. The collection of bones infusing their richness
into the opaque broth reminds us there is something to be said for time-
honoured traditions in cooking rather than the easy-way-out shortcuts so
prevalent in the West. As I tucked into the well done strips of tough meat, my
imagination continued running wild with visions of this elusive tÃ´ lá»›n
animal running wild around Phu Quoc.  
Somehow I convinced myself the soup contained goat or perhaps an animal even
more forbidden to Western tastes. An entire week would pass before a
Vietnamese friend finally revealed the true identity of my tÃ´ lá»›n breakfast
offerings. These two monosyllabic words are simply synonymous with the English
â€˜largeâ€™. Yes, large. Not goat. Not water buffalo. Nothing even remotely
exotic or strange. I simply had consumed a â€˜largeâ€™ bowl of rather
pedestrian cow beef soup. I will admit to a feeling of defeat upon discovering
tÃ´ lá»›n is hardly worthy of any culinary bragging rights.  
Just near Phá»Ÿ SÃ i GÃ²n and its tÃ´ lá»›n-sized tastes, a rickety, narrow
bridge over the fetid channel separating DÆ°Æ¡ng ÄÃ´ngâ€™s two halves carries
motorbikes and pedestrians into streets a world removed from our everyday
lives. A bustling market absolutely packed with vendors and shoppers alike
captures the imaginations of any foreigner who dares enter this display of
authenticity and grit. The boundary between store and sidewalk is a nebulous
blur as piles of anything and everything needed to sustain an island overflow
aplenty.  
A large collection of live chickens drew me in and a green weighing scale
partially hidden behind the table gave all the clues needed as to these
birdsâ€™ eventual fate. The proprietor deftly manoeuvered a string around one
birdâ€™s feet and tossed the clucking mass unceremoniously into the weighing
tray. Within minutes cash exchanged hands and this once catatonic bird
exhibited some new-found distress with wildly flapping wings as it was carted
away upside down by a woman driving a battered Honda Dream motorbike.  
I realized then and there I had been transported into a surreal world never to
be duplicated in the more sterile and predictable West, so I parked my bike to
wander in a bit deeper on foot. Aside from a few adventurous tourists, I was
the only Western interloper mixing with throngs of locals shopping for
traditional medicines, sea urchins, live ducks and more. This feast for the
eyes could easily shock the uninitiated into submission, but is this really
such a bad thing when we travel? Some of the scenes such as ducks heading to
the dinner table can disturb many of us with only a Western perspective, but
we just need to remind ourselves to look at the surrounding maelstrom through
a different prism and open mind.  
I will admit though some scenes cause me to just take pause and gawk like the
tourist I try so hard not to be. Just steps away from the chicken stand, a
cart with animal cuts hanging on hooks and lying in piles caused my head to
turn twice. I canâ€™t help but wonder how safe meat is after incubating in 33
degree Celsius heat, but this turned out to be the least of my musings. At the
time I still did not know the true meaning of tÃ´ lá»›n, so I just jumped
right in by asking the proprietress which was â€˜thá»‹t tÃ´ lá»›nâ€™, as I
knew thá»‹t meant â€˜meatâ€™. She just laughed and pointed to several meat
slabs while waving me off. Obviously my banal inquisitions not only were
holding up the line but had brought me no closer to an answer.  
After sending a customer off with a tÃ´ lá»›n-size bag of tripe, my butcher
friend climbed up on to her cart and plopped down amongst the meat. That
someone would actually perch barefoot amid raw, bloody animal parts sure did
test my Western sensibilities, but, judging by the steady stream of nonchalant
customers, this seems to be a standard market mode. I would later spy two
other women resting inside their carts as well, and I considered myself lucky
that Phu Quoc delivered such a sensory overload so previously unimaginable to
me.  
As fascinating as the street market was, an entire island awaited, so I
manoeuvered my bike through the crowds in a bid to find any road leading
northward. Alas, my journey came to another abrupt, unplanned stop as a green-
grey minivan caught my eye. I hit the brakes and circled back around to verify
I had indeed seen correctly. Sticks of incense tucked behind the front licence
plate sent skyward faint wisps of smoke while the vehicleâ€™s hazard lights
flashed in yellow unison next to white headlights shining bright.  
The English-speaking driver sensed my curiosity and explained, â€˜Vietnamese
people see the car as a person.â€™ He motioned to the front of the van with
its headlight eyes, bumper mouth and grill nose, and, due to this human
appearance, twice a month he appeased the gods with this morning ritual. A
table piled high with water, chocolate cookies and cigarettes seemed similar
enough to the altar offerings at Phá»Ÿ SÃ i GÃ²n, and the straws placed inside
the opened water bottles seemed such a thoughtful touch for the dear spirits.
I had always wondered why vehicle bumpers around Vietnam took along incense
for a ride, and finally, in Phu Quoc, the road less travelled yielded an
answer.  
As I chatted with the driver, a group of Western tourists scurried on by this
curious conduit between car and heavens without even noticing this scene so
different from our lives back home. A simple glance to the right would have
bought a souvenir memory so different from anything they possibly could have
imagined prior to arriving on the island. As I motored my way out of DÆ°Æ¡ng
ÄÃ´ng, I could not help but wonder if my bike had been properly blessed for
the journey ahead, and I hoped a day of safe travels would deliver me back to
Long Beach before sundown in one piece.

My knees felt closer to my chin than ever before. The driver was constantly on
the wrong side of the road. He persistently honked his hooter, and locals
continually turned and looked at us as though we were a species from another
planet. In our attempt to get off the tourist trail, we might have got more
than we had bargained for.  
Leaving the ever popular Halong Bay, Vietnam, on a local bus seemed like an
invigorating idea, until I was actually on the bus and found myself gripped
not only with paranoia that I would be robbed but with an honest fear for my
life.  
I have never seen such reckless driving, and, despite being a happy sleeper on
most modes of transport, I found myself wide awake and counting the minutes or
rather the hours (five!) until our arrival. Finally, jubilation washed over me
as I stepped off the bus and realised we were in a place very few backpackers
made the effort to visit, Ninh BÃ¬nh Province, 93 kilometres south of Hanoi.  
Standing with our backpacks fastened and sweat dripping off our brows, we
looked around desperately trying to orientate ourselves; Ninh BÃ¬nh City, the
capital of Ninh BÃ¬nh Province, was unassuming and didnâ€™t appear to have
anything mind-blowing about it. Then, to our surprise, two men on motorbikes
(clearly locals trying to make a quick buck) offered us a ride to the hotel we
were looking for. We settled, breathed another sigh of relief to be alive, and
decided to find out what there was to do in Ninh BÃ¬nh.  
The manager of the hotel was full of information and suggested we hire a
motorbike and head to a couple of areas just outside of town; he assured us
that we would not be disappointed. Having to pay only $5 for a motorbike, we
agreed to hire one the next day.  
We woke early on day two, ready for our first Southeast Asian motorbike
experience, but, after seeing the motorbike mayhem in Hanoi, we were also a
little apprehensive. However, after a few instructions and a brief list of
doâ€™s and donâ€™ts, Oliver and I were soon on our way â€“ first stop, Tam
Cá»‘c.  
The motorbike journey itself was amazing; after turning off the highway, we
were greeted by endless rice paddies, giant water buffalo and limestone
mountains. The scenery was breathtaking and the freshness of the air welcome
after the smog that choked Hanoi.  
Expecting a well-oiled tourist attraction, we were a little lost and confused
when it felt like we were in the middle of a rural Vietnamese town. Eventually
we figured out how to buy tickets and were ushered on to a small, wooden boat
that barely looked big enough to carry us. The tiny vessel swayed once or
twice, and then we were pleasantly gliding on the water as the noise on the
pier became increasingly distant.  
The man responsible for getting the boat moving decided that using his feet to
row was more efficient than using his hands. He sat back with his arms folded
and allowed his legs to lunge the boat forward, and soon we were moving at a
steady rhythm. It quickly became obvious that the foot-rowing method was
preferred by most boat men and women, as they could use their hands to do
other things, such as smoke and wave at passers-by.  
As we headed further down the river, the beauty of Tam Cá»‘c became ever more
apparent. It was as if we were in a lost world characterised by massive
limestone karsts that jutted out of the water and towered over us, making us
feel insignificant as they dwarfed our tiny boat. The karsts had dramatic
jagged edges from which trees seemed to grow out of every possible groove.
Adding to the beauty, bright, green rice paddies stretched from the river bank
to the foot of the casts, and the slight breeze made the paddies dance for us
in a display of natural beauty. The elements jointly added to the drama of the
scene while mist hugged the top of the mountains, making them increasingly
theatrical. Interestingly, the other-worldly landscape was not devoid of life,
as surefooted mountain goats climbed, played, and ate on the giant stone
formations.

**Ninh Binh karst landscape.**

_  
As we neared the end of the river, our boat was surrounded by women selling
merchandise from their boats. One woman approached our boat, held on to it,
and pleaded with us to buy some of her merchandise. We politely declined and
were stunned when she turned sour and became abrasive. Unfortunately this kind
of attitude had been common amongst Vietnamese merchants, and we cursed under
our breath that she was able to taint our experience. Not wanting the
saleslady to deter us from more adventures in Ninh BÃ¬nh, we decided it was
time to leave and climb back on our bike. With no set plan, we sporadically
stopped at temples and other attractions, and as we rode along the narrow
road, with acres of rice paddies on the right and tiny villages on the left,
the sun gently baked down on our exposed thighs and arms. While travelling on
the bike, the breeze saved us from the sweltering heat but not from our
hunger, and it was well past lunchtime when we stopped at a restaurant.

Park primate-rehabilitation centre.

Not sure what they sold or if anyone would be able to speak English, we
approached with caution. We were nicely surprised when a young teenager seemed
jubilant that we were there and that she could practise her English. We asked
her what was good, and she readily informed us that Ninh Binh was famous for
its goat meat. Having only ever heard that goat meat was very tough, I
eyeballed her closely. But not wanting to miss out on my Vietnamese
experience, I agreed to the goat, a little uncertain of what to expect.  
A plate of meat covered in an array of spices and fresh herbs arrived at our
table and tempted my nostrils, causing my mouth to water. The meat was
accompanied by a basket of fresh mint and other leaves, as well as some rice
paper and a home-made peanut sauce. Noticing our confusion, our teenage friend
eagerly gave us a demonstration. She quickly picked up rice paper and one of
the freshly picked leaves, and with each deft movement of her hands she added
yet another ingredient to what soon we saw was our first goat-and-leaf
sandwich. Flavours burst to life in my mouth, as the sweet mint and peanut
sauce greatly complimented the perfectly spiced (and surprisingly tender) goat
meat. Absolutely delectable!  
With tummies full and just a little bit of time left before we need to return
the bike, we opted for some driving. The wind whipped through our hair, the
breeze cooled our burnt skin, and the occasional whack of the bike (as a
result of shot suspension) kept us awake. Itâ€™s the perfect way to end the
day. Feeling tired and with our butts aching from the hard bike seat, we had a
beer in the hotelâ€™s courtyard and decided another day in Ninh Binh was a
must.  
On day three, we knew exactly where we wanted to go, CÃºc PhÆ°Æ¡ng National
Park. With directions in hand, we got back on the bike and were soon on our
way. A journey that should have taken only an hour turned into two, as one
wrong turn left us zipping up and down tiny alleyways and makeshift roads.
Realising we were lost, we plucked up enough courage to ask some locals where
we needed to go. This involved a series of awkward hand gestures, blank stares
and smiles, before we were on the right track again. Once at the park, we were
delighted to see it was not busy.  
CÃºc PhÆ°Æ¡ng National Park was well known for its primate rehabilitation
centre, which was our first stop. A knowledgeable guide walked us between the
primatesâ€™ cages, and we got a glimpse of some rare animals like the gibbon.
It was fascinating how different Asian primates were to African ones, with
their lighter colours and gentle faces. He told us stories of how these
animals had been hunted or orphaned and how they were slowly being
rehabilitated at CÃºc PhÆ°Æ¡ng. Unfortunately the tour was very short, but it
was informative and fascinating nonetheless.  
After that, we headed to the turtle-rehabilitation centre where we learnt
about the demise of reptiles in Asia as the demand for them in China
increased. Many species were nearing extinction, but the trade in terrapins
and turtles was lucrative, giving often destitute people a means of providing
for their families. It was a complex problem and the centre had a wealth of
information, not to mention how cool it was to see all the different turtles
that CÃºc PhÆ°Æ¡ng was rehabilitating and breeding to help the conservation
effort.  
After an informative morning, it was back on the bike, and we rode half-an-
hour through the park to get to our desired hiking trail. The thick vegetation
of the rainforest clinched to the side of the road, which was made up of a
series of up hills and down hills. The motorbikeâ€™s engine lightly grumbled
and added to the ever-growing noise coming from within the forest. Riding,
seemingly alone, through a rainforest was an exhilarating feeling.  
Then it was time to man up and hike. It was a novice hike through the thick
rainforest, and in the heat of the day we were drenched from head to toe,
before we even started. Insects seemed to have an insatiable attraction to us,
and they were bizarre to look at with their vibrant colours and odd shapes.
After walking for an hour, we reached an old tree, which was massive and rose
above the rest of the forest. Its majesty was simply awesome, despite being
littered with peopleâ€™s carved names. Exhausted from the hike and a full day
of sightseeing, we headed back to town (which thankfully took only an hour
this time), to get ready for our departure the next day.  
Whilst waiting for the bus to leave, we flicked through our photos and were
yet again amazed at how Ninh BÃ¬nh was adorned with natural gems. It was the
kind of place where you just wanted to get a bike and ride, while the rest of
the world slipped away, and where you could feel, smell, taste and see so much
of what Vietnam had to offer. Finally, the bus pulled up and we prayed we
would be more comfortable than we had been on the previous bus ride.

11/20/2019,Malaysia plus Monaco by th sea,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/malaysia-plus-monaco-by-th-sea/,,By Pip de Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Bai-Truoc---Vung-Tau.jpg,"_(No.4, Vol.2 Apr 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine, Advertorial)_

For Saigoners (I am sorry HCMCers just does not seem the right word), with the
only exception of Can Gio, which has far fewer attractions, Vung Tau is the
nearest seaside resort. The town was established by the French, who knew it as
Cap St Jacques. Largely owing to its oil-and-gas activities it also has its
fair share of business visitors. Despite its name â€˜Petro House, a Boutique
Business Hotelâ€™ is a fine choice of accommodation whether you are here for
business or pleasure. The location is ideal, and, whilst specialising in
Malaysian cuisine, it offers other excellent dining, with a wide choice of
international dishes. Furthermore, the rooms are spacious and luxurious and
there is a house entertainment facility for those who enjoy games of chance.  
Getting there is part of the adventure. You could choose to go by road, which
is cheaper. However, those who dislike travelling through the tedious endless
suburbs with little to see but the back of a lorry and do not mind paying a
little more should take to the waters of the Saigon River and avail themselves
of the quick hydrofoil express. With three companies there are plenty of daily
departures. The price one-way is VND200,000. They have given up the practice
of charging foreigners more, but if you travel on weekends it is a little more
expensive, VND250,000.  
I sat back in a comfortable chair and did something most of us do not do every
day although we may live so close to the river. I watched the fluvial life go
by. All manner of vessels from small launches, fishing boats and barges to
ocean-going merchant and luxury cruise ships ply this waterway. The land
scenery is mainly mangrove swamp on both sides. The mangroves themselves sit
on the muddy banks with their roots in view stretching down to the water. I
wondered what monsters lurked inside this mysterious vegetation. Internet
research reveals it is home among others to foxes, deer, boar, pythons, flying
foxes, semi-wild crocodiles and, over on the Can Gio side, notorious bands of
monkeys. In among the foliage is the indigo shrub â€“ something to dye for, I
suppose.

What is called Front Beach, at Vung Tau.The ferry terminal is on the far left
and Petro House in the distance beyond the park.  
Photo: Le My

After an hour or so, to oneâ€™s great relief, the low-relief scenery is broken
as the two mountains around which the city of Vung Tau is centred come into
view. Mountains they seem to this Englishman and to a Swiss they would be
hills. Soon we were docking at the Vung Tau maritime station, or ferry
terminal.  
Position, they say, is everything. Petro House, in Ward 1 (PhÆ°á»ng 1), is
just a fifteen-minute walk or a flag-fall taxi ride from the dock. It is
within a five-minute walk of a public swimming pool and tennis courts, the
greyhound stadium and the Front Beach esplanade. More to the point for my
Chief Procurement Officer, a.k.a. my wife, the Ward 1 one market is just
across the street.  
Another reason for coming to Vung Tau is to buy fresh fish and crabs. The
latter were not in this market but my wife did buy a whole â€˜cÃ¡ bÃ³pâ€™
(pronounced â€˜burpâ€™). In English this is called cobia fish. It is
absolutely delicious with its white flesh tasting of the crab upon which it
mainly feeds. We had it cut up into steaks and put on ice in a polystyrene
box. It served for four daysâ€™ of family meals and cost two-thirds of the
price in HCMC. The saving on the fish was equivalent to the price of our boat
tickets back to the city.  
Petro House quite rightly calls itself a boutique hotel. It has 48 rooms, in
four categories ranging from standard to executive. We had the pleasure of
trying out the latter. This kind of room would suit a family, especially one
with teenagers demanding a little separation from parents or vice-versa. It is
really two rooms made into one with separate bathroom facilities and each part
with its own widescreen television. There is a wide salon which would be good
for entertaining business clients. There are also two balconies to sit out on
at night and pipe-dream. They face the street, which is twentyfold quieter
than in HCMC. The room was tastefully furnished with some of those pictures
you can find in art galleries in downtown Saigon that depict street scenes of
girls in flowing white ao dais and conical hats and people gliding by on
bicycles. Ah, Vietnam without the reality of motor bikes â€“ so picturesque!
The rack rate for a standard room is sixty dollars inclusive of taxes. Our
room was $120. This included breakfast.  
Another reason for making the short hop over from HCMC to Petro House is to
try out the international cuisine at its Monaco Pub and Bistro. â€˜Pubâ€™ is
not quite the right word, as it occupies a cordoned-off section of the lobby.
Weather permitting, you can also dine outside on the ground-floor terrace. The
chef is Malaysian, so the main draw is the dishes from his home country. The
three main ethnic groups of Malaysia are represented. There are Indian curry
dishes and the Cantonese Penang Char Kuey Teow (fried flat noodles) is given a
twist with a version of it from Penang. But it was the Malay dishes I wanted
to taste.  
We ordered four widely different dishes: garlic bread in cheese (VND45,000 ),
sweet and sour fish (VND84,000 ), nasi lemak with chicken rendang (VND89,000 )
and French onion soup (VND45,000 ). Oh what a joy to discover a hotel that has
dispensed with tasteless beer in tins or bottles. Petro House quenches your
thirst with Danish Carlsberg on draught. Vietnam in general is slow to catch
on to the fact that most foreign beer-drinkers, at least, prefer beer fresh
and on tap and that this is acceptable for a respectable hotel. Could Petro
House be leading a revolution? At VND25,000 a glass I washed the food down
with two of these.  
The soup arrived first and at my wifeâ€™s end of the table. At first I thought
a mistake had been made and they had brought tripe soup. On closer inspection
what looked like tripe was in fact croutons unusually arranged in strips.
Nevertheless it was very tasty and even my wife, who is not used to foreign
food, thoroughly enjoyed it. Hot on its heels came the crunchy garlic bread.
This was also delicious. But next came the find of the evening â€“ a Malay
dish which is only available here at weekends. This is â€˜nasi lemakâ€™ with
chicken rendang. The former is rice cooked in coconut oil. The latter, which I
had had in Indonesia, is a very popular dish originating from a tribe of
Sumatra and has many regional variations. Basically it is a paste made from
coconut milk and spices, the main ones used being ginger, galangal, turmeric
leaves, lemon grass, shallots, and, noticeably, chillies. It was served with
peanuts and â€˜ikan bilisâ€™, or whitebait, the tiny fry familiar to the
Vietnamese as cÃ¡ cÆ¡m. I do not know if you are supposed to do this but I
mixed everything on the plate together and it all went down the hatch like a
treat. The last dish, the sweet and sour fish, took care of massaging our
remaining taste buds. Culinarily speaking, we felt as if we had been all
around Asia and France to boot.  
Friday night is Barbecue Buffet night at Petro House, with the grilling done
right on the terrace. I was not lucky enough to be there on a Friday, but it
seems a bargain draw at just VND300,000 . This includes three glasses of the
renowned draught beer. Seafood and meats dominate the table and, enough to
haul in heaps of Aussies and Poms, there is also that most exotic of fare for
Vietnam â€“ lamb.  
For non-Vietnamese-passport-holders, another attraction of Petro House might
be the e-gaming room with bar, on the ground floor. If the spin of the wheel
and roll of dice in glitzy surroundings is what you seek then Petro House has
it.  
All too soon and it is time to be heading home. A little tale to illustrate
how much attention the businessman can expect at Petro House. The evening
before leaving I had asked the staff to book our ferry tickets back to HCMC.
On checking out I was presented the actual tickets, complete with assigned
seat numbers.  
There you have it. If you are off to Vung Tau for a perfect and easy escape
from the runaway train that HCMC has become, Petro House would be a great
choice of place to stay. On business or to recharge your batteries, the
location is perfect. It has spacious and comfortable rooms. The versatility
and high standards of its cuisine means you can entertain and satisfy friends
or business partners of widely different food preferences.

11/20/2019,Well mounted in Mui Ne,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/well-mounted-in-mui-ne/,,By Pip De Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/9---Bathroom-Seahorse-Resor.jpg,"_(No.4, Vol.2 Apr 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine , Advertorial)_

Mui Ne, that tropical, beach-resort village that has mostly sprung up in the
last ten years or so east of Ho Chi Minh City, is a five-layered affair.
Proudly lofting it above all else are the sand dunes. Next comes a street a
couple of kilometres long lined with bars, restaurants and shops selling
souvenirs and everything the holidaymaker may need from sunscreen to liquor
and crocodile-skin ware. Mui Ne is a free rather than captive market and that
includes a wide choice of where to stay and eat. The hotels or resorts are
three- to four-star [Vietnam division. â€“ Ed.] and set in their own gardens.
With one exception they are low-rise, avoiding the eyesores of many a resort
that was planned before it. The last two layers are what people come for â€“ a
beautiful coconut-tree-fringed, orange-sandy beach and the expansive ocean
usually azure and dotted with fishing vessels.  
I cycled along the road passing a multitude of frontages of hotels or resorts
[the distinction is not easy to make on the ground, and the name given a place
is often only that. â€“ Ed.] in the three- and four-star categories. You have
a wide choice of accommodation in this range. The cheaper places are further
down and away from Seahorse Resort & Spaâ€™s prime beach location. Of course I
cannot vouch for them all but I can certainly tell you that one of the more
established hotels, the four-star Seahorse Resort & Spa, is more than just a
safe bet. The first advantage is that, if, like me, you need exercise and
enjoy exploring your immediate environment without adding to pollution,
Seahorse Resort & Spa offers you free bicycle-use. They have chosen a good
name, too. The seahorse is an aphrodisiac well known for finding its way into
many a bottle of Vietnamese wine. The Seahorse Resort & Spa promises to pep
you up during your stay by the sea.  
I alighted at the portals of Seahorse Resort & Spa from my air-conditioned
Sinh Cafe bus (VND100,000 for the five-hour trip from HCMC). Somehow I had
thought that this was the back entrance and I wandered through the coconut-
tree gardens in search of reception. Luckily a friendly employee chanced upon
this lost guest and led him back to perform the formalities at the roadside
offices. A welcoming fruit juice and a chat with very helpful check-in staff
left me confident that I was going to be well looked after.  
Soon I was comfortably settled in at my bungalow. Its location was excellent,
close to the infinity pool and also that beyond-infinity pool called the ocean
as well as the main dining facilities, which go under the French word for
seahorse, Hippocampe. There were seahorse motifs on the walls. All the
bungalows at Seahorse Resort & Spa are set well back from the road and have
the same facilities but they vary a little in price according to position. One
Internet booking site has them at between $147 and $202 a night. Standard
rooms are also available, quoted at $73 by the same source. My tastefully
decorated bungalow faced on one side to a garden stocked with tropical flowers
and leafery which is like a central courtyard, as four bungalows are arranged
around it. At the back through a door the bathroom and toilet were exposed to
the sky with another smaller garden with a high wall and bamboo blind. You
shower in the full bosom of nature here with the birds twittering in the
background.  
After my long road journey I was by now quite hungry so I trod over the
pathway and up the stairs to the Hippocampe dining hall which offered
international cuisine. Normally I am an easygoing, take-it as-it-comes sort of
diner. On this occasion however I decided to test just how Western or
international the food and service was. I put myself in the frame of mind of
the most fastidious and finicky eaters I know, for example, the Publishing
Consultant of this magazine. Arriving later than normal dining hours I had the
full attention of the staff and appreciation of the decor of black and red
hardwood dining tables and the tent-like beams and rafters above to myself.  
First up was an aperitif. I ordered a complicated one called Long Island Tea.
It was an education for me that this contains no actual tea. It only looks
like black tea in its long, tall glass. In my poor Vietnamese, I tried to make
it clear to the waiter, who had little English, that I wanted to see it mixed
in front of me. After some insistence and a trip backstage to the kitchen the
cocktail-mixer emerged. No gentleman in black suit and bow tie here, no
dancing a calypso as he mixed, no stainless-steel cocktail shaker to be
juggled and no decorative umbrella and slice of lemon on the rim of the glass.
The mixer dutifully mixed all the ingredients, as I watched: rum, vodka,
Cointreau, and red grape juice. He missed only the Coca-Cola, which was
described as a component on the drink list. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the
concoction and will look out for it again.  
The next piece of fun revolved around the entree. I chose vegetable soup
imagining that it would come as a clear soup. What it arrived as was cream of
vegetable soup. I was served no bread rolls. Another trip to the kitchen and I
had the pleasure of meeting the supervisor, a charming middle-aged lady who
spoke no English. By now the waiter was suffering from severe nervous
exhaustion and was substituted by a lovely young lady whose first trial with
me was a complaint that the rolls had not been warmed and to be astonished to
learn that a special knife was needed to spread the butter. Such a thing
existed in the kitchen and it was duly brought to the table.  
For main course I ordered the Aussie tenderloin steak. Steak is something I do
not normally have in Vietnam, this not being cattle country. It was as
succulent as could be, mÃ©daillon in form. It came with veggies and chips and
in a red-wine sauce. I had ordered it to be cooked medium but it came closer
to rare. That was not a problem at all. I like it both ways. I would that they
also asked you, â€˜How would you like your chips (French fries), sir?â€™ I
like them as reasonably large slices and not as they were here, little sticks
Ã la KFC.  
For dessert came crÃªme caramel with a delightful Vietnamese twist. It came on
ice on a beautiful light-green platter. As the caramel mixed into the melting
ice the custard became increasingly delicious, soothing the palate with its
coolness. Despite my quibbles and a few foibles I had rounded off an
excellent, filling meal served in the friendliest and most caring of manners.  
Breakfast served at this same venue came as a sumptuous buffet with everything
imaginable from both East and West to drink and eat. It was included in the
room rate. I ate it among throngs of mainly Russian fellow guests.  
Upon leaving the buffet I was met by the General Manager, Mr Tran Anh Tri, and
we enjoyed a nice cup of tea together at the poolside bar. He was anxious to
point out something I had not noticed: they have a mini rice paddy in the
gardens near Hippocampe. They actually harvest the rice too. I put it to Mr
Anh Tri that it must be difficult to cater to all the different demands and
expectations that all the many different nationalities have. He nodded in
agreement, accepting that in his business you never stop learning.  
Mr Anh Tri had arranged a tour of the grounds for me. Seeing the gardens in
broad daylight for the first time they did look stunning. â€˜Donâ€™t you worry
about coconuts falling on guestâ€™s heads?â€™ I casually enquired. â€˜Not to
worry about,â€™ that he replied, â€˜We harvest them well before that could
happen.â€™ I was shown the souvenir shop on the ground floor of the Hippocampe
building. It features reproductions of Champa art, a reminder that around Mui
Ne there are vestiges of this great civilisation that became almost swallowed
up by the southward advance of the Viets.  
Next we visited the spa. Whilst quite small, it had everything you might
expect: sauna, steam bath and massage rooms. Soothing piped music was playing
and the outdoor Jacuzzi even had a mini TV set clamped to one side. There was
also a tennis court. Mr Anh Tri informed that the gardens are irrigated by the
natural stream that runs through them. This is stocked with plenty of fish and
diverted at one point to form a pond. There are signs warning that it is quite
deep.

Most Western tourists these days are concerned that the hotels they stay at
are environmentally friendly. This was news until recently to many in Vietnam,
but Seahorse Resort & Spa was quick to heed it. Knowing that local recognition
of environmental good practice can be easily be obtained with the slip of an
envelope, and that anyone with a passing knowledge of Vietnam is aware of
this, Seahorse Resort & Spa has gone to lengths to obtain the Asean
(Association of South East Asian Nations) Green Award, thereby being only one
out of ten hotels in the country with this accolade.  
I spent the rest of the morning relaxing by reading a book on my bungalow
veranda and having a stroll along the beach. Furthermore I had a dip in the
pool where I overheard a woman with a broad Yorkshire accent expressing her
satisfaction with the hotel and Mui Ne in general. I even had time for the
breezy bicycle ride I mentioned earlier.  
All this activity worked up my appetite and I decided to do justice to
Seahorse Resort & Spaâ€™s other less formal restaurant, roadside, which goes
under the name of â€˜Bistroâ€™. I decided it was the time to try out the
Vietnamese food. Some people complain about the street noise but coming from
Saigon the location was not disturbing for me. Rice seedlings in a pot
decorated the table and a basket of fresh green coconuts hung from rafters to
the side of it. I ordered the seafood rice at VND154,000 to be followed by
pork cooked in a clay pot (Thá»‹t heo kho tá»™) at VND110,000, all to be
washed down by a bottle of Saigon Green beer. To my amazement the rice dish
came accompanied by bread rolls and butter complete with butter knife.
Laudably, they had learned the customerâ€™s preference and this had been
communicated between the two eateries. I smiled at the cultural
misunderstanding. In many years of living abroad myself I have made enough of
them. And after all an error of addition rather than omission is hardly an
error at all. Battting on their wicket they delivered their own countryâ€™s
food well. I left satisfied and fortified for the long trip back home.  
The Seahorse Resort & Spa has everything you need to recharge your batteries
with ozone from the sea, the sweet scents of its gardens and the soothing
therapies of its infinity pool and spa. Accommodation is to high standards and
to the state of the art in comfort. The food, beverage and services are tip-
top whilst there still may be a slight struggle at times to comprehend the
strange ways of foreigners. Think of the word â€˜seahorseâ€™ not to denote
something that needs to be immersed in wine but the place to immerse yourself
in when staying at the now famous beach village of Mui Ne.n

When talking of food there is definitely a French connection in Vietnam.
Witness the baguettes for sale on street corners at breakfast time. It may not
be in the DNA, as the modern idiom goes, but it is certainly in the language.
A few examples are cÃ rá»‘t (carotte, carrot), phi lÃª (filet, fillet), rÃ´ ti
(rÃ´ti, roasted), sÃºp lÆ¡ (choux-fleur, cauliflower) ba rÃ´ (poireau, leek),
á»‘p la (au plat, on the plate/ flat) as in bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ á»‘p la, a breakfast
favourite of fried eggs with baguette, and atisÃ´ (artichaut, artichoke).  
When a cuisine is on offer outside its own territory it is often modified to
suit local tastes or culture. The spice in Thai food is toned down in England
to make it acceptable to a people not used to having their palates set on
fire. Knives and forks need to be on the table for people who have never in
their lives used chopsticks. However, if I go to a French restaurant I prefer
to eat as the Parisians do. Whilst I am open to local variations or a little
creative fusion, I normally want my food to be, for want of a better word,
â€˜authenticâ€™.  
When I phoned to book a table to sample the fare at a new French restaurant I
was a little taken aback at being asked by a lady with a Vietnamese accent,
â€˜What dishes would you like to try?â€™ â€˜Thatâ€™s Okâ€™, I replied,
â€˜Iâ€™ll order courses from the menu.â€™ I worked in Beijing for two years
and would on occasion eat at the famous Russian restaurant where during
detente Nixon and Kissinger dined. They would serve Chinese-style a number of
dishes all at once and all in small portions. I was hoping that at Vatel my
meal would come in instalments and not in one downlayment.  
Vatel is on the fringes of District 1 in a street already famous for eateries,
Suong Nguyet Anh. It is very near the Cultural Park, which could come in
useful for a pre- or postprandial Dickensian stroll. You will dine in peace as
it is set back from the noisy road down a pebble driveway with flagstones that
have the names of cities and countries around the world. Vatel, as I was soon
to learn, operates as a global franchise of Vatel International Business
School Hotel and Tourism Management and is even present in Saudi Arabia,
though you will not be getting any wine-based sauces there.  
I was met at the door by Mrs Kim Thanh, assistant restaurant manager. She was
anxious to take me to see the school, on the floor above. I viewed the bright,
shiny classrooms and noted that in spite of its having been open only a few
months there was no shortage of students. Mrs Kim Thanh explained they
alternated between a week of theory here and a week of practical work in the
restaurant.  
Also on this floor is the kitchen where head chef M. Patrick Berenger was
demonstrating to a crowd of enthusiastic and beady-eyed apprentices how to
prepare the famous fish dish of â€˜bouillabaisseâ€™. This hotpot, not unlike
the Vietnamese láº©u cÃ¡, originates in the very fishy city of Marseille,
which has the good fortune to be on a rocky coastline which has plenty of
crayfish, an essential ingredient. The huge pot into which species of whole
fish are placed, as well as crustaceans, goes to serve ten people. As I was
dining alone I would not be trying it that today. Bouillabaisse, which
translates as boil and lower (simmer), owes its special place among fish soups
to the provenÃ§ale herbs which flavour the broth. Patrick adds these last.

Beef Bordeaux wine with shallot sauce

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Vatel-Restaurant-Saigon-3.jpg)  
SautÃ©ed tuna sashimi with sesame seeds.

It may be of interest at this point to recount the tragic story of the man
after whom the restaurant is named. Vatel was one of the most famous French
chefs of all time. Distraught at the late delivery of seafood for a banquet he
was preparing for King Louis XIV he quite literally fell upon his sword.
Kindly do not expect M. Berenger to do the same thing if your bouillabaisse
arrives a tad late!  
And so to dinner. I chose the prime location, next to a glass casing behind
which was a tropical garden and a wall down which a simulated waterfall
flowed. Now I knew I had come to a French establishment. The table was set
very comme il faut (in the way it ought) with knives dutifully placed each
side of the place mat and bright glasses too â€“ two for wine, two for water.
French pop music of the 1960s was gently playing in the background.  
It is comforting to know you can rely on a little French sauciness to liven up
even that most plain and simple of snacks â€“ poached egg on toast. The sauce
in question is called meurette. M. Steve Baum, who was acting maitre de that
lunchtime, explained to me that the ingredients were onion, lard and red wine
with the addition of some chopped bacon. This was priced at VND120,000 ($5.71)
and I had it for starters. I might well have gone for the gazpacho with orange
blossom (this is iced tomato soup) also at VND120,000 ($5.71) but as it was
Spanish I thought I would be wandering off the subject. Other options for an
entrÃ©e include sahshimi with sesame seeds, prawn cocktail with jackfruit
salad and sautÃ©ed duck livers.

The main courses featuring meat cost between VND280,000 ($13.33) and
VND380,000 ($18.10). They included filet mignon, brochettes (skewered meat)
and lamb chops sautÃ©ed a la provenÃ§ale. There were vegetarian courses on
offer for between VND120,000 ($5.71) and VND220,000 ($10.48) as well as
Vietnamese dishes at between VND120,000 ($5.71) and VND220,000 ($10.48). I
chose breast of chicken in cordon-bleu sauce, a creamy one with port wine and
mushroom. The actual chicken came roulade style, that is to say in slices
which were stuffed with bacon. It was all very mouthwatering.  
I had reserved space for a sweet course. It was a toss-up: either classically
French â€˜crÃªpes suzetteâ€™, which is pancakes with brandy, or crÃªme
brulÃ©e. The latter won out. This dish is largely something very familiar to
an Englishman, namely custard. It rounded things off perfectly.  
My liquid accompaniment was an apple juice at VND50,000 ($2.38), as this was a
working-day lunchtime. There are wines from round the world as well as France.
To give you an idea of prices, I noted that a normal Bordeaux A.O.C. Baron de
Rothschild cost VND420,000 ($20) a bottle or VND120,000 ($5.71) a glass whilst
a bottle of more upmarket Paulliac from the same region goes for VND2,650,000
($126.19).  
Those seeking to dine in the manner of the Paris of the West in the â€˜Paris
of the Eastâ€™, the sobriquet once given to Saigon, now know of one place to
do so. I shall not forget how keen to learn the secrets of French cooking and
serving the Vietnamese students at Vatel were. I have no doubt they will spawn
other excellent places to savour the cuisine of la belle France. A very â€˜bon
appetitâ€™ to all who dine at Vatel and to all our readers indeed!n

11/20/2019,Verticality arrives at Mui Ne,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/verticality-arrives-at-mui-ne/,,By Pip de Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Unique---Suite-room.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_8796.jpg,"_(No.3, Vol.2 Mar 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

In recent months Mui Ne, that beach village two hundred kilometres east of Ho
Chi Minh City that in the space of a mere ten years has achieved fame of the
same kind as tropical beach destinations like Kuta in Bali or Phukhet in
Thailand, has seen a new kid on the block. Actually it is the block as it is
the only accommodation that is a tower block among a long line of mainly
bungalow accommodations. Hence its name Unique Mui Ne Resort. Hopefully it
will retain that status and not become only the first of its kind. It is still
on its soft opening so for now it offers bargain rates . . .  
On my way there on the bus I overheard two British couples discuss how they
had chosen their hotels and they both said they had been influenced by the
website Trip Advisor. I checked the site and found out that Unique Mui Ne
Resort had glowing reviews from the public and was straight in at number seven
out of 16 Mui Ne establishments. I enquired when the grand opening would take
place to be met with the same answer as Obama gives about Afghanistan troop
withdrawal, i.e. â€˜When we are readyâ€™. Allow me to proceed to detail to you
what makes this place already special if not unique.  
Unique Mui Ne Resort is set back from the noise of the main road at the end of
a long flower-lined driveway. I was met at reception by Miss Florence Do Huu,
the manageress. Her English was so good that I took her for American but in
fact she had only gone to school there, having spent most of her young life in
Paris. She admitted there was a long way to go with staff training before she
could call for the grand opening. However, she said it was amazing the
difference even a couple of weeks of training made with the eager-to-learn
Vietnamese staff. One area which will take time is the upgrading of English-
language skills. At present I found myself resorting to my poor Vietnamese
with even the reception staff. The rapidity at which Mui Ne has developed
makes training especially important as it is now difficult to find staff with
all the requisite skills already in place. Nevertheless, most guests find
little reason to complain and occupancy was 100 per cent and even though I had
arrived at noon I needed to wait forty minutes before a room became available.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Unique---Suite-room.jpg)

An environmentally friendly feature of the hotel which Florence was quick to
point out is that the place is designed like a Gulf Arab wind tower to capture
all the sea breezes to a natural air-conditioning effect. Iâ€™ll swear my
Deluxe Sea View Room (rack rate $140 (VND2,940,000) benefited from this,
though air-conditioning was provided, with in-room controls. Aside from wind
there are solar panels on the roof. Also, environmentally, staff are regularly
involved in beach clean-ups.  
During the time waiting for the room to be ready Florence took me on a tour of
the hotel. The wine cellar had been prepared and awaited being fully stocked.
Downstairs there is a spa with massage rooms, steam bath and sauna. Something
I found fairly unique if we may apply the qualifier â€˜fairlyâ€™ to the word
â€˜uniqueâ€™ is that above the entrance there is an overhead aquarium with coi
carp (cÃ¡ chÃ©p) swimming above you. This is particularly beautiful at night
when mobile blue footlights shine on to it. Out through the basement doors and
there is the lounge cum dining room and the infinity pool with the beach
butressed against it. There is also the oceanfront Sea View restaurant which
offers a la carte international cuisine and breakfast, lunch and dinner
buffets. The hotel has access to the beach that is immediate and has a good
number of rooms that face the beach albeit that some at ground level have
views of a neighbouring placeâ€™s gardens.  
My Deluxe Ocean View Room was a real and spacious gem. Unique in my experience
was the bathroom which not only had the standard spray shower but also an
overhead one that made you feel as if it were raining. I was on the third
floor with great views including the long line of manicured beach until it
loses itself in the corner of Phan Thiet Bay that is the Mui Ne peninsular
with the little blob of Hon Rom island after the â€˜noseâ€™. To the side were
the gardens of neighbouring resorts. Practically to the height of my room in
their leapings, people were kite-surfing on the sea. Had the breeze been
stronger they could have been above me and I imagined Englandâ€™s greatest
fictional spy since James Bond strapped to one these dropping on to the
balcony, bursting into the room and erroneously arresting me in his inimitable
bungling way.  
A week or two before my stay Unique Mui Ne Resort had played an active and
important role in the holding of an international kite-surfing competition.
Despite little wind on most of the days this event had been deemed a success
with participation from many countries. Next year of course promises an event
better one.  
On to that unique feature for a Mui Ne beachfront property â€“ the roof. It is
not ready yet. Wind-breaks will need to be installed, as it is, as you can
imagine, quite breezy up here. However there are plans for a restaurant and
bar which can also be booked for private parties. Honeymooners please note
that there have already been candlelit dinners for two here and there is space
to accommodate functions for up to two hundred people.  
No better place than this roof to enjoy that daily half-hour display of ever-
deepening hues of tangerine and blues that ends in darkness and the turning of
the sea into the Indian-ink black called a tropical sunset. Sadly, with a
hotel full of people, I was the only one there to witness this majestic free
show that nature has for the taking.  
  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_8796.jpg)

The beach that had been packed during the day was now still. There was only a
young Russian couple frolicking in the surf and a Vietnamese man crouching
with arms outstretched as you see men in the streets at conversation doing. It
is unusual to see the gregarious Vietnamese without company. I wondered if he
were a poet or a philosopher. Perhaps he was contemplating ending it all by
drowning himself. The answer was as unfathomable as the ocean itself. I was of
course watching the sun set over the East Sea (more familiarly known as the
South China Sea to Westerners) and the sun sets in the west so no great
fireball slowly being swallowed by the waters as you get in say Manila Bay. I
did look west and saw an ominous sight â€“ the dune skyline that Mui Ne is
famous for is beginning to disappear. Already there are low-rise buildings on
one section and another area has been bulldozed with earthen works in place
for further development. Of course there will be spectacular sunsets to view
from peopleâ€™s balconies up there but apart from the environmental damage I
hope they know what they are doing. Will nature one day claim back her own in
the form of landslides?  
Florence has already carried out a staff recruitment coup in securing the
services of experienced middle-aged French chef M. Marc Grenouillon. He could
well be the one and only foreign chef in Mui Ne to remember it as it was in
the beginning. Although he has not been here continuously he has memories of
Mui Ne dating back to 1995. I myself first came in 2000 so we had some
conversation reminiscing about when there were only two real hotels on the
whole stretch of this coast.  
I trusted my palate to Marc for dinner in the lounge bar. First up was a
cocktail aperitif. I chose a Mojito priced at VND95,000 ($4.52). Though
Mexican in origin all the ingredients for this low alcoholic but high calorie
content drink are readily available in Vietnam. They are sparkling water,
lime, sugar, white rum and mint. I tried one of these last year in a Saigon
hostelry of renown but this was better. The contrasting dark and light green
hues were more beautiful and with a greater use of mint the taste was more
delicious.  
Marcâ€™s dishes are original if not unique for Mui Ne Vietnamese-French
fusion. â€˜Gá»i BÃ²â€™, that Vietnamese dish that often gets translated as
beef salad, was given a new twist but using raw beef carpaccio-style and more
citrus flavouring than usual. It came served with prawn crackers. A
scrumptious start to the meal at VND95,000 ($4.52). Next came a dish that I
first thought was fish but actually was slices of squid resembling scales and
arranged in a fish shape. Great presentation and with a mix of vinaigrette and
butter sauce it was great-tasting (VND90,000 ($4.28)). For the â€˜piÃ¨ce de
rÃ©sistanceâ€™ I went for â€˜CÃ¡ Thu Kho Tá»™â€™ or mackerel baked in a clay
pot with plain rice and veggies in garlic at VND95,000 ($4.52). All in all
very fine dining at very reasonable prices.  
I awoke from very sweet slumbers just before dawn and sat out on the balcony
to find out just where that errant sun of the evening before had hidden
herself. There she was gradually appearing over the line of the Mui Ne
peninsular and beaming a golden roadway over the blue satin sea which ran
uncannily right up to the sands in front of the Unique Mui Ne Resort. Absolute
magic!  
Why do these tides of Northern Europeans strike the Mui Ne shores in February?
It could all be summed up in one chilling word, â€˜Murmanskâ€™. That was
whence hailed the gentleman with whom I had a brief conversation in the lift
using up all my limited Russian vocabulary. What a difference a day had made
for him! From the near perma darkness, the icy blasts and whiteouts of the
Arctic 69 degrees north to this shining tropical beach. He had chosen well his
accommodation. He need only step out of his hotel to be on that beach. He
could view it from his wide and airy-cool room and balcony along with the
coconut groves. There was fine wining and dining and he could restore his
weary body at the spa on site. This is only the soft opening. By the time you
get there it should be close to perfection. I have the strong feeling that
from the Unique Mui Ne Resort â€˜we ainâ€™t seen nothing yet!â€™n

11/20/2019,Cultural cliché defeated in one hour,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/cultural-cliche-defeated-in-one-hour/,,By Pip de Rouvray,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/permit_5.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/The-bamboo-dance.jpg,"_(No.3, Vol.2 Mar 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

Twice a month at the Ho Chi Minh City Opera House a theatrical troupe from
Mekong Artists serves up an extravaganza of a whole colourful kaleidoscope of
traditional song, dance, music, street life and legends from Vietnamese
culture. If I were to sum it all up in just three words and three punctuation
marks, which I know you are not supposed to do in an introduction, I would
describe it as â€˜absolutely superlative degree!!!â€™ If there were Oscars for
this kind of show the aptly named â€˜Soul of Vietnamâ€™ (Há»“n Viá»‡t) would
sweep the board; best score, best choreography, best stage effects, best
costumes, best performers, best script and best lighting.  
Try to get there early, as you will be treated in the foyer to green tea as
well as, â€˜chÃ¨â€™ (usually translated as sweet soup) and cold spring rolls
to be dipped in a peanut sauce. These are all served by â€˜street vendorsâ€™
in traditional garbs complete with bamboo pole and baskets.  
After this reminder that Vietnamese culture is all around for those who have
eyes to see, I was ushered to the front row and seated next to a gentleman as
illustrious as his name suggests, a co-founder of the troupe, Mr Richard
Asinari di San Marzano. Those less privileged than I
with_a_complimentary_ticket_pay VND100,000,_VND150,000_or VND300,000, which,
given the large number of performers and the elaborate costumes and scenery,
is a snip of a price. The show lasts an hour and proceeds at fast pace with
never a dull moment. It comes in six acts. A fine lady dressed in traditional
ao dai with her hat sparkling like diamonds in the stage lighting introduces
each part. I shall proceed to describe just what you can expect to see in each
one.  
The first act depicts the legend of heroines the two Trung sisters. The
opening takes you back to the early era of Vietnamese history with scenes of
tiger-hunting and the tilling of the land. A toddler is led by her grandmother
through the fields. Then there is the triumphant entry on parade of the
sisters on quite realistic looking elephants. There is a fiery sword dance
with warriors demonstrating their skills in battle reinforcing the brave
struggle of the sisters to uphold Vietnamese independence.  
This is followed by a dramatisation of a second popular tale namely that of
Cuoi the Buffalo Boy and the Banyan Tree. Ingeniously, it starts with a child
skipping, leading to a depiction of the gamut of games Vietnamese children
traditionally play. They gather around a bearded storyteller with a man
playing the flute in accompaniment as they listen to the tale itself. The
stage is filled with colourful mist and you are transported to the jungle
where Cuoi witnesses a tigressâ€™s curing her injured cub with the leaves of a
banyan tree. He sees the tree has magical qualities and uses it to cure
people. Unfortunately the tree can only live by being tended with clean water.
There follows a really memorable scene, as, one day, being desperate, the boy
urinates on the tree, which uproots and, with Cuoi clinging to it like an
acrobat, is transported to the moon. Great scenic effects!  
On to the third act, in which you are treated to an education in Vietnamese
musical instruments, folk song and the operatic Cáº£i LÆ°Æ¡ng. To introduce
this the narrator sings a time-honoured lullaby. On display are the more
familiar instruments that contribute to the melodious sonority of Vietnamese
music â€“ the lute, zither, and â€˜dan nhiâ€™ or two-chord fiddle. Further
adding to the sounds of the soul of Vietnam was one that fascinated me. A
woman holding two ceramic teacups in each hand used them to the same effect as
the Andalousians with castanets. A female soloist in a royal purple ao dai
sings a song from the ancient capital of Hue. Then on stage come boats and
there ensues a performance of the River Song, composed, as Richard informed
me, in 1917. Finally, a four-string quartet performs livelily and in a style
somewhat reminiscent of Irish folk music.  
Act four I had seen before, and, bizarrely, far from Vietnam, in Northern
Portugal, where the performers are called â€˜Pauliteirosâ€™. A line of dancers
skip in and out of pairs of bamboo poles which are moved as in puppetry by
people on both sides of them. The rhythmic clapping of the poles adds to the
excitement and you may even find yourself foot-tapping away too. The costumes
are of course different. This is a highland dance and the dancers wear bright-
red and black ethnic clothing, but this fast-moving dodging dance is exactly
the same. One wonders if the Portuguese learned it on their trading adventures
in Hoi An port.  
For our fifth treat the curtain rose for the Há»“n Viá»‡t ensemble, who
performed behind a magnificent golden dragon boat. Richard points out that
there are on stage some well known Vietnamese players, one of whom he
describes as a â€˜national treasureâ€™. Há»“n Viá»‡t plays a gamut of
traditional regional musical themes from the North, Centre and South.  
Next it is the turn of street culture to the fore. It is all there minus the
famous motorbikes. A massage-provider clicking her sticks is the first crier
to appear from straight out of the audience. A lady hails a cyclo. Then on
comes an ice-cream salesman and soon the stage is full of the cries of all
manner of street hawkers and street life.  
Just when you thought it could not possibly get any better it does, as this is
followed by the grand finale. A man dressed in shaman-like clothing and
looking like an Incan plays the â€˜music of the mountainsâ€™ on a stone
xylophone. Soon he is accompanied by a virtuoso performance on the bamboo
flute at times imitating shrill birdsong. The flautist, who wrote the
composition himself, is the famous Mr Do Loc. Now, to say his rendition took
my breath away would be sheer understatement. I was left floundering on the
floor gasping for paramedic attention!  
Amazingly, all this has been packed into one hour and all these people who
have provided so much pleasure assemble for the curtain call. All these
talented people on stage and who should steal the attention with her coy
little wave to the audience but the nineteen-month-old baby girl. Her proud
Dad is none other than the person sitting next to me, Richard.  
Hats off to Mekong Artists, who have provided me with my first ever rave
review. If there is anyone sitting in the British Council reading this you
could earn yourself a lot of kudos if you could carry off the coup of engaging
this act for a UK tour.  
In sum, this is a celebration of everything that is beautiful about this
wonderful land. Along with the water puppetry this is a must see/do for any
visitor to Vietnam. Dull would he be of spirit indeed anyone who could fail to
be moved by this pot pourri of music, song dance and legend which comes all-
inclusive of the strong contribution that both the ordinary person in the
street and the highland minorities bring to Vietnamese culture.  
Note Há»“n Viá»‡t/Soul of Vietnam plays at the Ho Chi Minh City Opera House at
5 p.m. every 15th and 23rd of the month.n

I hope all of the readers have enjoyed a happy New Year. ChÃºc má»«ng nÄƒm
má»›i to you all! This is a great season in Vietnam with warm weather, great
food and happy feelings in a great city. At a time when Northern Europe has
been well below zero and dark, we have been warm and sun-drenched.  
As readers know, I have previously described the joys of living in Vietnam. I
will describe one more place to acquire some of those joys.  
I have found another place that provides great quality at a good price.  
T & M Silk, at 155 Dong Khoi Street, near the corner of Le Loi, specialises in
silk items of all types – neckties, handkerchiefs, scarves, dresses. It also
provides top-quality custom-tailored menâ€™s clothing, such as shirts and
suits.  
Prices are not dirt cheap, but the discerning buyer will find value. Their
neckties are smooth as the night air. Their suits and sport jackets fit like a
glove. I have never worn a ladiesâ€™ gown. However, based on their appearance,
as well as judging by the fit and comfort of their clothing for men, I would
think that members of the opposite sex would find such items worth a try.  
The staff are courteous and nice. They are always willing to give discounts to
buyers of multiple items. They will make every effort to satisfy you and make
sure you leave with a smile on your face and dongs in your wallet.  
Whether you are a native Vietnamese, an expatriate looking to supplement your
wardrobe or a tourist looking for high-quality clothing items for a fair
price, pay a visit and see what I mean.

11/20/2019,The great branch of Hanoi,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/the-great-branch-of-hanoi/,,By Douglas Jardine,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_6668-Cau-Long-Bien-By-M.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_6835--Cau-Long-Bien-By-.jpg,"_(No.3, Vol.2 Mar 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

The first time I saw the Long Bien Bridge was in the 1970â€™s â€“ I was a
young boy living in Connecticut in the United States. In my home there was a
stack of old Time Magazines and dating from some years before was an article
about the United States Air force bombing of Long Bien Bridge in Hanoi. I
brought the magazine to my 4th grade teacher, Mr Logie. I was very lucky to
have teachers like Mr Logie throughout my life â€“ he gave me a very truthful
perspective about the Vietnam War, which was still going on at the time. Mr
Logie told me about the people of Hanoiâ€™s heroic defence of the Long Bien
Bridge and their city against the seemingly unstoppable might of the United
States Air Force. In this Time Magazine article there was an aerial photograph
of Hanoi, and I would stare at this photograph for hours, as children often
do, as if they can almost enter the photograph. I remember staring at places
in Hanoi which would come to mean so much to me later in life: Hoan Kiem Lake,
West Lake and the Centre Island [BÃ£i Giá»¯a] in the Red River that the Long
Bien Bridge touches.  
Another momentous thing happened to me at this time of my life. A neighbour
had taught me to take pictures and how to develop film. I soon built a
darkroom in the basement of my house using old cardboard boxes and black
plastic bags that I cut up for light-proofing. This was the beginning of a
life in photography. The Vietnam War came to an end (for the Americans â€“ it
went on for two more years in Vietnam [until 1975]) while I was in Mr
Logieâ€™s class. Every week we would see the casualty reports on the news in
our class â€“ usually about 200 killed every week. Finally the number of
killed in action dropped to one person. Mr Logieâ€™s comment was, â€˜That was
one person too many.â€™  
  
**In 2010 Thá»ƒ Thao VÄƒn HÃ³a weekly newspaper and Maison  
des Arts held a competition in which people would  
tell their stories of Long Bien Bridge.  
The present article is one of the  
stories. It was sent to  
Vietnam Heritage by the  
competition organizer.**

In my life I have had a career as an artist and later I started a second
career as a historian. After studying Asian history, culture and philosophy
for some years I lived in China for one year and after that in India. I had
wanted to live in Vietnam for some time as I had studied Vietnamese history
and culture under Dr Bruce Franklin at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Dr
Franklin taught the history of the American from a more Vietnamese perspective
and under his direction we read great works of Vietnamese literature in
English translation, such as Dumb Luck (by Vu Trong Phung) and The Sorrow of
War (by Bao Ninh). In 2006 I was privileged to come to Hanoi and teach at
Hanoi University in the Faculty of International Studies. My own research
activities tended towards historical urban studies and so my long study of the
history and culture of Hanoi began.  
My research in China and India had prepared me for this study. I had become
interested in the social and historical meanings of and memory of fixed urban
structures. One of the first urban structures of Hanoi I began to investigate
was, of course, the Long Bien Bridge. My childhood memory of and fascination
with this bridge had never left me and it was very much in my thoughts as my
plane landed at Hanoiâ€™s Noi Bai Airport.  
My first experience on the bridge was powerful. History lives on this bridge
and for a historian this can be almost overwhelming. The wartime repairs still
dominate the appearance of the bridge. The heroic struggle of the people of
Hanoi to defend this bridge and their city still lives in graphic detail. This
was a living panorama of the article in Time Magazine that I had read as a
child. The most obvious remnants of the Vietnam War are the missing spans of
the bridge â€“ giving the Long Bien Bridge a â€˜telegraphingâ€™ appearance.
The most meaningful remnants, however, are actually underneath the bridge and
can be viewed on Centre Island (which is accessed by Long Bien Bridge).  
The original support columns built by the French construction company DaydÃ© &
PillÃ© were made of carefully masoned stone. Most of these support columns
were destroyed in the American bombing campaigns known as â€˜Operation Rolling
Thunderâ€™ around 1967-68. This meant that new support columns had to be
constructed. Some are made of salvaged steel â€˜Iâ€™ beams. Some are made of
poured concrete and one is literally a box of stones contained by a frame of
steel beams. What stuck me about each of these repairs was that they were so
individual â€“ each column a unique solution. It was quite obvious that each
repair team had been allotted a certain amount and kind of materials to create
the replacement support columns. Each solution is unique and creative and it
is a testament to the people of Hanoi, who struggled long ago, that their
repairs are still in service today.  
I began to return to the bridge often, maybe hundreds of times. As I stood on
the bridge, and on Centre Island, I began to realize how time and space were
collapsed or squashed on the bridge. Long Bien Bridge is not just a bridge
between Hanoi and Gia Lam but between the past, present and even the future.
Long Bien Bridge is a living example for me of how a fixed monument, like a
bridge, can have many meanings for people through time. During the French
period, when the bridge was built, it was a symbol and example French
technological â€˜superiorityâ€™. This was meant to contrast with the
Vietnamese technological â€˜inferiority.â€™ And, indeed, Paul Doumer (the
original name of Long Bien Bridge) created Hanoi as the capital of French
Indochina, as it was the essential communication link with Hai Phong and the
north and the south of Vietnam. Memories of this time are still evident today
as people often call the bridge the â€˜horizontal Eiffel Towerâ€™ even though
there is no evidence that Gustave Eiffel, the French designer of the Eiffel
Tower, was ever involved with Long Bien Bridge.

It was the French War and the Vietnam War that changed this meaning of the
Long Bien Bridge for the people of Hanoi, Vietnam and the world. After the
French withdrew in 1954 Paul Doumer was renamed Long Bien Bridge. It was said
that Long Bien was the name of a fishing village that stood on the opposite
bank of the Red River from Hanoi. This name-change is very significant as it
passed â€˜spiritualâ€™ as well actual ownership from the French to the
Vietnamese.  
During the Vietnam War (1960-1975) the identity of the Long Bien Bridge became
even more intensely Vietnamese as Hanoians fought to defend and repair the
bridge in the face of American bombardment. This signalled two important
realities. One, that no matter how much America bombed the north of Vietnam
they could not break the will of the Vietnamese to fight and reunify their
country. Two, that the Vietnamese were capable of effectively resisting a
seemingly technologically superior enemy, the United States. These meanings
were not only evident to the Vietnamese people but to the world, through the
international media.  
These are past meanings of Long Bien Bridge and they are also part of its
present meanings. I discovered the meanings by very conventional means of
historical investigation, by researching documents and interviewing people. I
began to wonder, â€˜How can I discover the new meanings, or contemporary
meanings of Long Bien Bridge?â€™ As I experienced Long Bien Bridge I realized
it was an environment, an area of Hanoi that affected many peoples lives. I
decided to explore this aspect through photography and by getting to know the
people who lived in the area.  
Photography had been apart of my life since childhood, but actually I had not
photographed seriously for many years. When I arrived in Vietnam something
happened. This aspect of my life was reawakened by Vietnam itself, at first as
part of my research and then as an aspect and art in its own right. I do not
use digital photography, I do black-and-white film photography, as I always
have. People often ask me why I donâ€™t use digital equipment or why I use
black-and-white rather colour film? There is no clear answer to this except
that I feel that film and black-and-white is an art form worth preserving and
practising. In addition, the medium of black and film has the effect of
bringing the past into present, as often the image is reminiscent of
historical photographs.  
I have now been photographing the Long Bien Bridge for about three years. I
have taken over a thousand images. I have documented the wartime repairs and I
have tried to document the many ways of life around the bridge and the ways in
which the Long Bien Bridge shapes those lives. Through photographing the
bridge I have come to see it as a beautiful historical creation, a work of art
that has been shaped by many hands and through time.  
About a year ago I began to create panorama views of the Long Bien Bridge. I
was actually inspired by Vietnamese photographers. During the Vietnam War
Vietnamese photographers in Hanoi created panoramic views of the American bomb
damage in Hanoi by cutting and pasting their photographs together. I instantly
understood their intention; some subjects or events are too big to be
contained in a single photographic frame. In a certain sense the long or
expansive view of a panoramic photograph can contain this increased meaning.
This was the view, or the way seeing, that I wanted to bring to Long Bien
Bridge. Always, my panoramas of the Long Bien Bridge relate the bridge to its
surrounding environment and show the reality of the presence of the bridge in
peopleâ€™s lives. The panoramic medium is ideal for this.  
I visit the Long Bien Bridge once a week, sometimes more. I have found that
Long Bien Bridge is a place and environment for many people who have perhaps
been left behind in Äá»•i Má»›i, Vietnamâ€™s economic miracle. In this area
the poorest people of Hanoi live, some on boats, some in floating houses and
some on farms on the Centre Island. I have learned so much about these people
in the last three years and I have seen their struggle to emerge from poverty.
My experience with these people, especially those who live in the floating
houses, is that they are kind and generous even though have so little. I have
photographed them in good times and bad. I have photographed how beautiful
days can bring many Hanoians to the centre island for recreation. At these
times their lives seem peaceful and idyllic. I have also photographed how a
fierce storm can wreck their lives and destroy their homes in one night. I
have seen how they must struggle for the most basic comforts such as
electricity and clean water.  
Long Bien Bridge is ever-preset and is vital to their lives. To the people who
live on the Centre Island survival is closely linked to the bridge. Long Bien
Bridge serves as their main link to Hanoi proper. They must travel the bridge
every day to scour the city for recyclables to wash in the Red River and then
resell for cash. The Long Bien Bridge is also a platform for informal
commerce, the corn, which grows on the island, the corn that is famous for its
sweet taste, is purchased on the bridge by passing travellers. Beyond this the
support columns that rest in the water between the Hanoi bank of the Red River
and Centre Island create a great fishing ground. The people who live in the
floating community can either eat the fish or sell it for additional income.  
Often I take groups of students and visitors for walks on and around the Long
Bien Bridge. My students at the Faculty of International Studies at Hanoi
University have become very involved in these communities. They have made
films of the peopleâ€™s lives and created service cum learning programs to try
and help the people who live in this area. One incident really stands out in
my mind.  
My students and I were one day carrying out research among the floating
community that is on the Hanoi bank of the Red River almost directly under the
Long Bien Bridge. As chance would have it a dead man washed up in the
community on the shore of the river. This unfortunate man was a stranger but
that did not prevent the residents of this community from taking respectful
care of this stranger. The people of the community cleaned the man up and made
a bed for him. They then covered him and burned incense around his body. You
can tell a lot about people by how they treat a stranger. This was a powerful
lesson for my students and myself about the dignity and worth of this
community.  
If you were to come on one of my walks to the Long Bien Bridge it would
probably go something like this. First we would enter the bridge road on the
Hanoi side. We might pause at the road entrance where the caves are under the
road ramp. These were used as a hospital in the Vietnam War. We might also
talk about how during the great famine of 1945, in which 2 million Vietnamese
died, armies of starving people wandered across the bridge to try to find food
and life in Hanoi. Most did not survive. The caves under the road ramp were
also used to temporarily store the bodies of the famine victims as they a
provided a cool environment.  
As we begin to walk across the bridge we have a great view of the Hanoi Fruit
Market. Here all the fruit Hanoi and the area produces arrives by truck and is
wholesaled to different vendors and distributors. It is a lively scene. As we
pass the Fruit Market it is also a good place to admire one of the original
manufacturing plates fixed to the side of the bridge. It reads DaydÃ© & PillÃ©
1899-1902, DaydÃ© & PillÃ© being the French construction company that built
â€˜Paul Doumerâ€™.  
We arrive at open space over the channel of the Red River that lies between
the Hanoi bank and Centre Island. This is a good place to talk as it is an
open area and area of commerce. It’s a little noisy because the motorbikes are
roaring by. Here we can talk about French colonialism, Hanoi and the Long Bien
Bridge. We can also see two distinct floating communities. One right in front
of us is a community of floating houses. The oldest residents have been there
for ten years. On the opposite side is another floating community. These
people actually live in boats and have much greater mobility. I think this
gives them an economic advantage over the people in the floating houses. We
can look at photographs that are one hundred years old and see similar
communities in the same place. Only the hulls of their boats are different. In
older times they were made of wood, today they are made of steel.

Next we walk to the staircase that will take us to Centre Island. But before
this people usually notice the missing spans of the Long Bien Bridge. This is
a good place to start talking about the American bombing of Long Bien Bridge
and the Vietnam War in general.  
As we walk down to Centre Island I have to caution my guests. The ground in
this area is littered with discarded hypodermic needles. Itâ€™s important to
be careful where you step. Drug addicts come across the bridge at night and do
their drugs and sleep under the bridge here. You can often find dozens of
discarded needles and discarded wrappers for chips and other snack food.  
From here we walk a metre to view the underside of the bridge. This is the
best place to talk about the Vietnam War and the defence of the Long Bien
Bridge and Hanoi. Here we can see the different replacement support columns
that were fabricated in 1968 and they are placed next to one of the original
French stone support columns, which makes a very graphic comparison.  
At this point my group usually begins to notice how beautiful Centre Island
is, and often we may see middle-class Hanoians bicycling by for nothing more
than recreation. But now it is time for a walk and to meet some of the people
who live on the island.  
We walk along a path with the bridge to our back. There is a small community
of floating houses a very short distance away on the Red River side of the
Island. The people are friendly and some even invite you into their floating
home for tea. Itâ€™s important to remember what a luxury this is, as the ice
has had to be carried all the way from Hanoi across the Long Bien Bridge.
Recently this community was devastated by a violent thunderstorm and many of
these homes where destroyed. The residents now struggle to rebuild them.  
Many of the people in the floating communities work for the people who have
houses on the island. They work as field hands as the people who have houses
on dry land are farmers and farm the island. Some of these households are in
their second generation of farming here. They occupy their land by custom
rather than legal ownership. They have told my students and me that life is
becoming increasingly hard as the level of the Red River gets lower every
year. This means less floodwater to bring the life-giving silt to their soil.
Their crops are becoming poorer and poorer.  
We return the bridge and begin our walk back to Hanoi. But there is one more
question that haunts me, one more discussion to be had. It concerns the
proposed restoration of the Long Bien Bridge. The French Government will
assist in this restoration. The Eiffel Company will be involved (even though
they did not build the bridge). My concern is that if they restore the Long
Bien Bridge to its original design specifications, the Long Bien Bridge will
become Paul Doumer again. This will erase all the wartime repairs of the
bridge. This will also erase the physical memory of that heroic struggle when
the Hanoians and the Vietnamese people battled and defeated the largest army
in the world. I, with the boundless love to the heroic bridge and Hanoi, do
believe that some elements of these war-time repairs, perhaps the grouping of
support columns on the Centre Island, must be preserved and memorialized to
keep this sacred memory for future generations.  
Through every conceivable odds or possibility, I have grown to love the Long
Bien Bridge. It entered my mind in childhood in faraway United States. I have
experienced its history and the Long Bien Bridgeâ€™s impact on the everyday
life of so many people who could not walk across this great structure and feel
its magnificence. I was married here in Hanoi in 2009. The day before my
wedding I asked my wife to get into her wedding dress and I took her
photograph, the wind blowing and traffic buzzing by, on the Bridge.n

T he record for the longest reclining Buddha statue in Vietnam was broken in
2010. The new holder, at 52 metres, is at a pagoda in the town of Thu Dau Mot,
near Ho Chi Minh City. However, it is the previous holder, three metres
shorter, which is supposed to represent the number of years Siddhartha Guatama
lived, that is still attracting all the attention. Hewn from a single chunk of
white marble it was made of cement when I was there and 11 metres high, it
rests near the top of the granite Ta Cu mountain, in Binh Thuan Province. Most
foreign tourists are just whisked by on a bus taking them to the beaches of
Phan Thiet and Mui Ne. Even if they do know of it, it may be too much trouble
for them to backtrack the thirty kilometres or so to the site. As a result,
the vast majority of people coming here are locals. If you do manage make it
you will be well rewarded for your efforts. On my first trip here there was
just the mountain, which you had to ascend and descend on foot, a new pagoda
and the statue. Now Ta Cu is a fully developed tourist area with landscaped
gardens at the foot and a cable car with smart restaurants alongside both top
and bottom stations. Ta Cu also offers you the opportunity of experiencing the
South East Asian jungle on a short, safe and easy trek. There now follows an
account of my third and recent visit to this sacred and inspiring place.

_  
I had no trouble getting there that day, as we were staying near the mountain
at my sister-in-lawâ€™s fruit farm. The most hair-raising part of the day was
the short trip along National Route 1 on the back of my brother-in-law’s
motorbike with lorries and long-distance buses thundering by. We arrived
safely at the gates of the tourist area, which is half-a-kilometre down a
quiet lane branching off this main thoroughfare. There are various ticket
options. Nguyen Minh Thu, at 63, had a return ticket for the cable car, which
cost VND75,000. I, being a sprightly 56, was going to accompany him up but
walk down. I paid VND55,000 for this. If you just want to enter and either
just enjoy the gardens at plain-level, perhaps have a picnic or meal in the
restaurant and/or go on a paddle boat on the lake or walk both ways, up to and
down from the pagoda, the charge is VND15,000.  
From the gate it is a short and pleasant walk through lovely gardens to the
cable-car station. However, there was a golf-cart-type train awaiting us, into
which we climbed, and were were brusquely and rudely carried away at a speed
far too fast for my liking. We climbed some steps to the accompaniment of
Julio Iglesias singing on the public system and entered our bright shiny
cabin. The cable car is Austrian, with automatic opening and closing of the
doors. The length is 1,600 metres and it takes you through the jungle just
above the highest trees to 505 metres above the plain. You can sit back and
enjoy the magnificent scenery of fruit farms and brick fields with mountains
out on the western horizon. Then, after hitting the top, the line goes down
for a couple of hundred metres. Here you should turn around and view the sweep
of the coast going all the way to Ba Ria Vung Tau Province, with the islet of
Ke Ga in the near distance. Just as we reached the top station I espied a
large black bird of prey, which I took to be a good omen.  
From here getting to the actual Buddha statue involves a little walking and
climbing of steep stairways. First you walk a hundred metres or so on an even
path. Give yourself ample time now to take in the shoreline and forest below
that you may have just glimpsed from the cable car. Then walk up a long and
steep granite staircase to the pagoda. Although this dates back to the 19th
century, much of it is new and indeed still under construction. To the left
you follow a path and, passing some graves with inscriptions in Chinese, you
come to a platform area with three tall male and female statues alongside each
other. They are quite beautiful. They are named Di ÄÃ Tam TÃ´n, in
Vietnamese, and the tallest reaches six-and-a-half metres. Then, a little
further along, turn left and walk up another tiring staircase to meet the
reclining Buddha of Siddharta Guatama entering nirvana. If you are not
breathless already from the climbing you certainly will be when you feast your
eyes on this amazing sight. Not only is he 49 metres long but he is seven
metres tall, and positioned on a six-tiered granite plinth all along. â€˜How
on earth did they get this huge white marble chunk up here?â€™ I asked brother
in law Anh Thu. â€˜Airliftedâ€™ came the reply. I should add that all the way
on this walk we have met only Vietnamese tourists. Anh Thu has been met with
constant enquiries as to my identity. So much so in fact that for most of them
it seems that I am the tourist attraction and not the views, the pagoda and
statue.

It remains for me to give an account of my journey down on foot. Before I
begin I would urge you to be more prepared than I was. Firstly, I did not have
the right clothes. I was wearing trousers and my normal working shoes. I had
no walking stick for support. I was going alone, which is a bit foolhardy. In
my favour I exercise a lot and am reasonably fit for my fifty six years, and
my daughter was to check up on me by cell phone. As I parted from my companion
at the cable car station and set off on the narrow path I felt like the White
Rabbit in Alice In Wonderland. Trees pressed in on me on either side and the
canopy obscured the sky. The sensation was of descending a tube of vegetation.
You heard on occasion the eponymous sound of the Táº¯c KÃ¨ lizard and the
tweeting of birds but the prevailing noise is that of a constant whine like
that of electricity passing through a wire. At first the way was rough, as I
clambered slowly down over rocks, placing my foot on the roots of trees with
their branches and bamboo stalks for support. For the first thirty seven
minutes I come across just one other walker. Then I reached a properly made
staircase, which was just as well, as the path was now steeper. This staircase
continued to almost the bottom but was broken in many places. From then on I
came across parties of chirping youngsters on their way up. I do not think
there was another climber even half my age that day and I felt in fine fettle
as I heard several of them wheezing and complaining of exhaustion. There were
a number of resting-spots with benches and I descended the mountain at a slow
and cautious pace. The first time I was on this mountain, before the cable
car, there were shacks with people selling refreshments near the top and
bottom. These are still there but the only soul around was a dog guarding one
of them.  
You will know when you are approaching the end. First there is a break in the
trees and you can see cars gliding on the cable above. Then you reach a small
stream. On this occasion I startled a number of birds there. Then suddenly you
find yourself at the level of the bottom station and, jubilation, you have
just another hundred metres of unmade path and rocks ahead to find yourself
back in the park. It had taken me an hour and forty minutes. I confess to
having felt very stiff but I was also very pleased with myself. Although my
aim had not been to break any records but rather not to break any bones, my
time was just five minutes more than on a descent I had made six years before.  
I hope I have whetted you appetite for safe adventure and that more English-
readers will put Ta Cu on their tourist itinerary. There are scenic views and
a cable-car ride which can be fun for young and old. Whilst one may have
pagoda fatigue, the magnificent reclining Buddha will be new. If you are
coming to Southeast Asia, some direct experience of the jungle is a must, and
this is a safe and easy place for it.n

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_8620.jpg)

Four or five hours out of Saigon, to the west, the way the Hiep Thanh
companyâ€™s minibus goes to TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u, An Giang Province, you come to one of
two main channels of the Mekong. You follow the bank, keeping the river on the
left, and come to a ferry at Chá»£ VÃ m, or Vam Market. It seems to take about
half-an-hour to cross the river, but I have never been able to time it
exactly, as once I am on the ferry I go into a state of mind which has to do
with only how the ferry goes and what is on the river, like fleets of sand
dredges or boats full of compressed rubbish, on their way to or from another
country. This Tet (the Vietnamese for Lunar New Year) we got to the ferry well
after dark, and photographs I took of the ferryâ€™s landing bridge made it
look like the end of a dusty, brown road. The water swished underneath it and
beyond was the dark and the lights of the opposite shore that caused a beaded
curtain of reflections off small waves. This is the kind of ferry that is
boarded and disembarked from the same end, so vehicles have to be backed
during embarkation, and the landing bridge is at the front.  
Ferries in Asia are famously overloaded, and on the ferry at this place on the
Mekong there are usually several four-wheeled vehicles and a great many more
passengers and motorbikes than I can imagine going on the life rafts that are
visible, so I take several empty plastic drink bottles as floats, which I
imagine I would stuff under my shirt. If you had a recognisable float,
wouldnâ€™t others want to share, when lurch came to splash? This night it was
my 11th crossing (and recrossing) for Tet. Most people remain sitting in the
minibus, but I get out for the ‘fresh air’, which turns out to be a pleasing
understatement on the Mekong, at least this far up toward Cambodia: the first
breath is like a transfusion, as if a stick of crushed sugar cane were put
back through the juicer and it came out whole again. The river may be
polluted, but it is not dead, not the stinking dead that has recently stopped
the Vietnamese in many places round the country launching the Kitchen God on
the traditional goldfish in a stream or pond, at Táº¿t.  
Having travelled a long while with the Mekong on the left of the bus, on the
other side, after you disembark at Chá»£ PhÃº LÃ¢m, or Phu Lam Market, it is
on the right, as you continue ever â€˜deeper in the Mekong Deltaâ€™, to use
the come-on of the Victoria Chau Doc Hotel. If it is in the daytime beside the
road there are people who remind me of India, for the way they are obviously
part of a world that they constitute and can never leave. There is a
moustached mystic in a cloak, like a walking statue, and a vendor who can
carry a stack of produce a metre high on her head. On the way back, after the
Tet holiday, we met a series of motorbike-drawn carts so heavily loaded with
sacks that the boss had apparently told the drivers to keep exactly on the
centre line, because, if they moved over, the camber would throw the lot on
the verge. But on the way to Táº¿t this time it was night and sleepy, and
there had been fewer people on the ferry; the ferry had already pulled away
from shore at Chá»£ VÃ m when our minibus turned up, and come back in to fetch
us. Across the river, and in something less than an hour from Chá»£ PhÃº LÃ¢m,
we arrive at the town of TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u, literally â€˜new settlementâ€™, where
Hiep Thanh has its terminus.  
I am not promoting Hiep Thanh, but it is a Saigon-Tan Chau specialist line
that I have nearly always used. The seats are numbered on a plan and I and my
wife always book the three that constitute the row immediately back from the
driver, three, four and five. These days there are taxis at TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u, some,
at least, run by Hiep Thanh, and government buses, but there are still plenty
of pushbike-drawn carts (xe lÃ´i) and Honda Ã´ms, perhaps more than before.
Four kilometres beyond the terminal, on the road to ChÃ¢u Äá»‘c, we come to
the houses of my wifeâ€™s brothers and sisters and their children. We pass
through pillared gates and a grove of yellow-blossoming Táº¿t apricot trees in
huge planters. We always sleep in the same room, upstairs at the back. Usually
it has not been used for months and needs to be cleared of gecko guano before
the mattress is put on the floor and the mosquito net hung. This time a mummy-
dry gecko fell out of a plastic picture frame and my wife, whose etiolated
portrait was in the frame, nonchalantly picked it up in a paper handkerchief
to throw it out the window.  
The most savage thing of my early years of Táº¿t (Vietnamese for Lunar New
Year) at TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u was the screaming of the pigs slaughtered somewhere nearby
at about 4 a.m. They complained like people for quite a while before petering
out, on the one hand into a basin of blood and on the other a body to be cut
up for the market, each part an entire delicacy, from the flowery ears to the
curly tail. Blood-curdling also came later, in the making of the pudding. This
year, after some years of no 4 a.m. waking (probably due to a piece of town-
planning), the yard of the house next door, outside our window, had become a
mixed poultry yard, in which the primary birds were two white geese, who
sounded as if they were blowing party hooters that unfurled to a feather.
After several mornings of involuntary study of the sounds of the geese, not
much later than the old pig-slaughtering hour, it became apparent that they
had their own interpretation of â€˜Cock a doodle doâ€™, which they seemed to
have picked up from a black cock, or rooster, that also occupied the yard,
along with a speckled hen, unless the spots were scrap boiled rice thrown so
evenly by the master. A â€˜Cock a doodle doâ€™ from a cock, which may be
supposed to own the intellectual property, is, strangely, a much more
difficult, strangled sound than one from a goose.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_9171.jpg)  
Lions and the Land Deity circle their reward at the 188 CafÃ©.

The poultry had an attentive master, who who was upset when later in the
morning I found that babushka oats from Russia and two other less exotic
brands had all gone off and I threw some out the window. Throwing stuff out
the window is a sport in Vietnam, like riding a motorbike in Ho Chi Minh City
or snow skiing, but I was relieved that after a few hours the poultry had not
developed staggers. In fancying the fowl yard I was not peculiar, as a niece
aged 12 elbowed me and pointed out hens sitting high in the trees outside the
window. One tree was a mango tree and another a starfruit tree. Starfruit
ripened and languished because we did not have a fruit-sized, clasping cage on
a pole to grab it. The geese occasionally stretched and flapped their wings,
especially when a little breeze came up, and I imagined a row of geese on a
mandarinâ€™s windowsill, before bowls of water, flapping wingspans of air in,
for air-conditioning.  
Higher on the shopping list than a harvesting cage on a pole were a vá»£t
báº¯t muá»—i, not quite literally a ‘racquet to kill mosquitoes’, because
â€˜báº¯tâ€™ is not as strong as ‘kill’ and is probably a euphemism, and a new
mosquito net. You sometimes encounter, in Vietnam, ferocious, huge mosquitoes
that could probably be used in hospitals for taking blood samples, under a
low-tech program in which the mosquitoes were squashed after biting the
patient and the blood looked at under a microscope. Some of these flying
syringes were among the kinds of mosquitoes at TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u at Táº¿t. Everyone
needs to check before they go, but it is widely said in the Mekong Delta at
the moment that there is no malaria. In southern Vietnam, I know of recent
cases of dengue fever, however, which I understand is carried by day-biting
mosquitoes, whereas malaria is carried by night-biting ones.  
The old net was too small this year. My elbow rested against it in the night
and I woke with a thick, itchy, red patch on it, where apparently mosquitoes
had crowded to gorge, as on a pincushion. There were so many mosquitoes in the
room that getting in or out of the net once would let three or four in. The
new net, which cost about VND100,000, or $5, at a local market, was almost too
big for the room. Its roof was printed with blooms of the poisonous oxalis, in
the botanically accurate colours, pink, blue and yellow, half-a-metre across;
in spaces there was the hint â€˜oxaâ€™. The walls of the net were pink, which
my wifeâ€™s father used to say was a very good colour for a mosquito net. In
discussion of the net, my wife remarked that they were not for sale at the Ben
Thanh Market, the central market in Ho Chi Minh City, though I gather since
that this is not strictly a fact but just a reaction to a notion that the city
is now so developed that there are no mosquitoes, what with the roaring civic
puffers of hydrocarbon smoke – like hold-in-the-hand, under-serviced
motorbikes – and air-conditioners that transfer environmental problems to the
mountainous areas of hydro-electricity dams.  
Once you have a decent net that falls liberally to the floor well away from
your mattress, or even bed, should you be one of the â€˜developingâ€™ people,
you need to kill the handful of mosquitoes inside the net, in the dark if you
donâ€™t have a little reading light with a switch on the end of a cord that
passes under the net. At a shop in ChÃ¢u Äá»‘c I came across a racquet with a
torch shining directly backward out the end of the handle for VND80,000, or
$4. While the strokes applied in killing mosquitoes are those used by Roger
Federer, whose longevity in the game is due to his playing â€˜within
himselfâ€™, it is advisable not to fall into adjusting the strings, especially
while your thumb or a finger of the other hand is still on the button that
delivers the charge. I absent-mindedly occasioned myself a jolt up the arm; it
is not as if I had not read the warning on the packet, but the racquet is so
like a tennis one, and a quite well balanced one at that. I know of no
mosquito racquet that has the Federer name on it, and it might also be helpful
to have a Rolex watch built in along with the torch. What I like to do is turn
the racquet on and look at the specks of defunct mosquitoes that stick to it
and light up like stars and galaxies.  
The racquet has to be used in the morning as well, around the whole room. You
don’t have to be able to see the mosquitoes. Just play shots and somehow you
get all the mozzies. That is, except for the ones that sit sleepily on the
walls, full of blood, and, it seems, alcohol, especially at Táº¿t. Hold the
racquet so that it approaches the wall evenly, as with a drop volley close to
the net, and listen to the crackle, which is in fact a small thunder-clap, or
series of them, and smell the burnt insect and blood, like the smoke from
silk, which is the nearest you may ever get these days to the smell of the
â€˜napalm in the morning, or which may stand in for the perfume of a roaring
road at a coffee shop, something so liked these days by those who have become
dependent on the brain numbness that follows, that also slows the carrying out
of such things as a metro system. Donâ€™t play the shots in the muscular way
of Raphael Nadal, however, and collapse a knee or elbow, and impale the
racquet on a nail or clothes rack, which will destroy what a salesperson at an
Apple shop would call â€˜your new toyâ€™. This toy is so powerful it takes the
best part of 24 hours to charge, according to the package, and the charge
lasts a vastly longer time even than that of a MacBook Air. No wonder some of
the â€˜landsmenâ€™ among the expats of HCMC ask themselves whether an electric
racquet could not be altered at home to make a Taser, or at least a cattle
prod or encourager for self-styled â€˜English-language studentsâ€™.  
Having bothered to stay alive this much in TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u, and having discarded
three brands of morning porridge, what about breakfast? For this we need to
start with a consideration of the bathroom – several square metres containing
a squat toilet, a broad-gauge cold tap like a fire hydrant, that even has a
red handle, and a plastic dish – because if you get the eating bowl, the
cooking pot, the spoon or the chopsticks dirty they have to be washed in the
bathroom. So it is better to go to one of the two first-class restaurants in
this part of the province, one at central TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u, only four kilometres
away, and one at ChÃ¢u Äá»‘c, 13 kilometres away. You may think I have been
conservative in going to the same place for Táº¿t for 11 years, but in that
time the surroundings also have stayed very much the same. One thing that has
changed is transportation, as I have said, which has been elaborated, not
denatured.

An old woman on a bicycle-drawn cart at Chau Doc.

On my early stays at TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u I had to take a bicycle-drawn cart to the
doctor when I was vomiting like a waterfall off the veranda due to blithely
having eaten the village-cooked food. I could not make it to the doctorâ€™s,
as I was so ill, but sat on a verge that happened to be behind the hospital,
where I was taken in and asked to â€˜vomit out the window, not on the
floorâ€™. The small, elegant, timber-and-stainless-steel carts are still
ubiquitous, and seem to continue to be being made, with an appreciation of
their pleasing style. Where you would pay VND 100,000 for a taxi, you should
pay nearly as much for a ride on the most environmental cart and less than
half as much on the back of a motorbike, a xe Ã´m, literally, â€˜hug
wheelsâ€™, as, to be safest, you must put your arms around the driver. These
days there is also the government bus, which costs VND 7,000 to ChÃ¢u Äá»‘c.
To get into ChÃ¢u Äá»‘c you first get off the bus at its terminus and on to a
ferry that is embarked at one end and disembarked at the other. You are
crossing another stream of the Mekong, but it takes only five minutes or so.
Turn right when you get off and walk along the riverbank to the Victoria Chau
Doc Hotel, part of the mighty Indochinese chain with geographical positions as
good as those got by the churches in the West. The ferry costs VND 1,000, or
5c.

A house at Tan Chau, of a common and picturesque wooden kind.

At the Victoria Chau Doc, where this time I was paid, in the form of two room-
nights, the thing to order, as far as I am concerned, is the rack of lamb,
followed by the dessert with two balls of strawberry yoghurt in a meringue
corral in a sea of orange sauce and topped with mint leaves. I donâ€™t think
this time the lamb was quite as well aged as in previous years – perhaps
someone in the supply chain doesnâ€™t think this matters anymore, though it
does, for the real flavour and texture. The frozen-yoghurt dish was as good as
or better than, at the first few tries, it had been even during the first
decade of the 21st century, but on the final try the meringue was powdery. I
know they cook everything themselves, and I have been into the kitchen and
looked at the meringue in the oven. These are pioneering young men and women
who cook for fastidious French people on return to the old colony, in a very
alien place. Considering the context, the kitchen and the restaurant are
phenomenal, despite my many criticisms. This deep in the Mekong Delta, to
argue about the qualities of the VCCH is like arguing in a distant oasis that
the dates are slightly off the gold standard. The breakfast bacon has in
recent years been curiously thin and anaemic, and this time the breakfast
pancakes were not replenished at anywhere need the speed the clientele
required. Failure to replenish buffets is Vietnamâ€™s most widespread and
worst service problem; it means the customer cannot actually get the product
and the service paid for, and it says, though perhaps accidentally, that the
hotel does not care what the customers think of it and it remains a mystery
what the hotel thinks of them. The comment book gushes at the VCDH, but I
would say the streams of guests, an enormous number filing through to or from
Phnom Penh, up the river, must to some extent be expressing an unconscious
relief, a teddy-bear sense of coming home, in an â€˜adventure destinationâ€™,
Indochina.

People marvel at the Victoria Chau Doc Hotel for its giving the impression of
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Plants grow up the legs of the table tennis
table, on the backs of deck chairs and in the toilets. This is largely due to
the strong environmental influence of a daughter of a landmark general
manager, Mr Man. She is a lecturer in environment. As well, there is the lá»¥c
bÃ¬nh, the water hyacinth, which floats to the right, down the river, and
turns round with its sails of leaves in the wind and floats back up again,
sometimes going round a certain yellow buoy that features in the all-day-
gazing view from the veranda of the VCDH under a fan-wafted ceiling of brown,
varnished, woven rattan or leaf. The old brown of the hotel in its rooms is so
redolent of more relaxed times that one of my Vietnamese relatives designed
his own drink servery in the some style and gave the plan to a carpenter to
make for his new Swiss-chalet-style concrete house. Though the house is in an
old, mud-brown village, you would not be surprised to see a pair of crossed
skis on the pediment, such is the icy, slightly blue tint of the Mont Blanc
architecture.

A vendorâ€™s cart in front of a flagging development hoarding facing the river
in Tan Chau.

So, here we are back in the village and it is a bit tedious taking the bus 13
kilometres every day, and very soon in the two weeks of Táº¿t it is time to go
the other direction to TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u for something to eat. This is not to say all
the time was given to eating out. The majority of the sisters-in-law can cook,
and in a hygienic manner, and there are the ceremonies of Táº¿t, which include
numerous rounds of bowing at ancestral altars, knees on the floor and forehead
hitting a pad of the hands clasped on the floor four times each round. The
ceremonies contributed to my losing several kilos, a reduction of about 2 per
cent. I know we have not come to any of the tourist sights of the region â€“
they will be for a another month â€“ but now we are beyond the territory where
you are likely to go anyway; at TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u, my home town in Vietnam, I reckon
I must have seen three white men or women in 11 years, though I have come
across one, a Frenchman, who seems to live, or spend quite a bit of time, a
few kilometres away. There was a time when my presence in the town was a
threat to civic peace, as I was welcomed so enthusiastically, or,
alternatively, as a bit of sport for yahoos, who these days have chestnut
hair.  
Now we are approaching the last word in eating on the TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u-ChÃ¢u Äá»‘c
axis, so deep in the Mekong Delta. But first it is worth spending a little
time on the riverbank, not forgetting that TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u is on one stream of the
Mekong and ChÃ¢u Äá»‘c on another. For some years there has been a long
hoarding along the TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u esplanade advertising a forthcoming development
to include a hotel, villas and a coffee shop. It has been going to be suave,
according to the pictures on the hoarding. Big, dark cars would have been
driven out of swishing garages by chauffeurs while their owners were in dark
suits on mobile phones with dark briefcases in the other hand. But by now the
pictures, done on some sort of cloth, are drooping like theatre curtains,
folding and coming off in places, and the pictures have turned a uniform
washed-out blue that most signs seem to over time and in the sun in Vietnam.
Before I went west for Tet this time, a relative told me a riverfront hotel
had been built. I immediately thought of the hoarding, and thought the
development was coming true, however rare it was for a hoarding proposal to be
carried through in Vietnam in these times of high bank interest rates. But it
turned out what was being referred to was another, new but unlavish, tallish
hotel, further along from the hoarding. I was there one evening, and was
intrigued, and went in and asked, because the windows, on what looked like all
of the many floors, were dark. Werenâ€™t there any guests in the hotel? I
asked. The receptionist replied that the hotel provided â€˜massageâ€™, on the
6th floor.

High-school girls go to siesta recess in Tan Chau

Civic pride in TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u had reached what it had in the 1950s in some towns
in the West, and planters sat on concrete sawn-off tree trunks and a pair of
yellow deer stood on an island of lawn, along with a gigantic, stainless-
steel, mausoleum-style sign on a stone support so long that it blocked out
almost the entire view of the mighty Mekong from a cafe across the road. The
sign read nothing more than Thá»‹ XÃ£ TÃ¢n ChÃ¢u, the thá»‹ xÃ£ meaning a town
of a higher order. According to civic pride, the recent announcement of the
promotion of the former ordinary town is huge progress. It doesnâ€™t matter
what we outsiders think of the environment or tourism, which attitude is
rather pleasing; there are no â€˜traditionalâ€™ dances or â€˜tourismâ€™
initiatives. In recent years the banks of the river have been falling in, and
a road has been put along the bank as a toughener. Some buildings have fallen
in the river, and half of some have, and superb cross-sections of buildings
remain, with the vestiges of staircases still embossed on and the ordure of
life still rubbed on walls that are like the ends of surgical amputations.  
The Duy restaurant, not far away, close to the Post Office, is an inexplicable
marvel, and in the case of this venue I am not bound to say so. There are very
few restaurants in the country that cook so consistently to such a high
standard dishes that are appreciated equally by Vietnamese and Westerners.
There are faded ads on the walls for such things as livestock feeds and growth
â€˜programsâ€™ for aquaculture. Some of the locals drink beer, quickly become
red-faced, loud and slurring and kick off their shoes and spit on the floor,
and cans and serviettes and other debris accumulate like trophies under the
table. I donâ€™t know where they get the wine from for the chicken steamed
with wine, gÃ háº¥p rÆ°á»£u, but the dish is sublime, with the giblets in.
Though you need not eat them, the giblets give an additional dimension to the
taste of the meat. And this is only my fall-back dish, after I have eaten
alarming numbers of plates of prawn fritters, day after day. Now, the prawns,
tÃ´m lÄƒn bá»™t, are not fatty, done the Duy way, and the crust of flour,
furry, not greasy, makes a good carbohydrate balancer. A dozen or so big
prawns come on a bed of lettuce and sliced raw tomato and raw onion, very
healthy. I dip the prawns in a sauce called nÆ°á»›c xÃ­ muá»™i, to which may
be added a little extra chilli. This sauce is orange-red, and perhaps made
from a fruit of this colour, and has the stringy consistency of saliva, and it
so delicious that you donâ€™t want to put yourself off by asking asking every
detail of what it is made of. The Duy has a good range of dishes, including a
lot of different animals without taking any from the Vietnamese Red Book of
endangered species. I have never got a stomach ache from the Duy, even though
these days I eat the leaves, as mentioned, and drink Coca-Cola or Pepsi on
iceberg chunks. A meal at the Duy is around VND 100,000 to VND 200,000, or $5
to $10.  
Over the road from the Duy this time, I got the heart-wrenching sight of high-
school girls coming out for the siesta recess on the first day of the return
after Táº¿t. They were many and they were all in pure white, exquisitely
diaphanous Ã¡o dÃ is (traditional long dresses), often pushing silver-painted
bicycles. One had a large, appliquÃ© heart on her hat band. Another showed an
expanse of nape as she lifted her hair to fiddle with it. Here was
breathtaking sophistication in a mud-coloured town. Geese cricked their necks
like minibus-drivers, and dipped in aluminium dishes of water to wash
themselves, never getting as white as high school girls, and scenes were
palimpsested over with electrical wires, the wires becoming part of
photography, through de facto resignation, a postmodern â€˜deletionâ€™.  
Then there is the noise, even at the Duy, with the road traffic and troupes of
wandering lion dancers banging symbols and drums, driving out lazy devils and
stupidities of the old year in the recesses of establishments that pay for the
service along the roads, or pouncing on a can of beer, a can of soft drink and
an orange at the 188 coffee lounge next door to the Duy, the doof-doof music
of boys with yellowish-red hair blown as if by a cyclone of the Central
Region, and the shipâ€™s-horn blasts from the government buses, which can
cause air-drum pain. Deeper in the Mekong Delta, ever deeper, over 11 years,
and deeper than ever on return to HCMC to the peace of five-star hotel
lounges. The villages of the upper Mekong Delta mostly line roads on banks
between paddy ricefields harvested three times a year. Nowadays, road-accident
ambulances pass with sirens on on these banks dozens of times day, adding to
ever-increasing beeping, roaring, howling cacophony. My wifeâ€™s familyâ€™s
houses are in this situation and are becoming another place in the country
made unendurable by various forms of pollution. Home karaoke sets, black and
massive, like funeral marble, with two silver-caged ice-cream shapes of
microphones, have become as prevalent as the brass sets that are polished
every year and go on the ancestral altar. A karoake session was so loud an
accepted village simpleton was provoked to make an intelligent protest.n

_  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_8211-Front-of-Celadon.jpg)

In Hue, in 2010, I could smell the flowers and the still-living water of the
Perfume River, and in the Celadon Palace hotel, in Hue, which is now the
Indochine Palace, part of the Best Western chain, I could smell the wool of
the carpets in the suite and the leather of armchairs in spots such as the Au
Rendezvous lounge. This leather was â€˜fedâ€™, as Mr Paul Stoll, who conceived
of this exceptional hotel, said, and I got the sense that the armchairs would
make excellent substitutes for pets in places where the maximum in animals
allowed would be a ladyâ€™s lapdog. The Celadonâ€™s atmosphere had to care for
probably the biggest collection of 21st-century Vietnamese arts-and-crafts
furniture in existence. These extraordinarily-well executed works were
protected in many instances by glass tops suspended on shirt-button-sized and
-shaped points of transparent sealer, to allow the atmosphere, in the climatic
sense, to reach the wood. The atmosphere, in the sense of climate, of the
Celadon was not to be compared with that of Hue, or Saigon, or even that of a
museum. There was nothing like the Celadon (nowadays Indochine) Palace, unless
it was an enormous house. The windows in our suite could be opened if we
wished, so that the still-living Hue atmosphere, not desssicated and dusty
from development, could join the wool and leather, unmediated by air-
conditioning, to produce an atmosphere (literally) rarely experienced since,
for example, on another part of the Asian continent, the British Raj.  
In our suite, table-top lamps had large, square, rich-brown, ceramic teapots
for bodies. The body of the lamp on the desk was a weighty, metal elephant.
The carpet was patterned with branches and flowers of a blossom tree. The
carpets all through the now Indochine Palace seemed to be patterned on
different kinds of trees, with both botanical and artistic precision. We could
but imagine the Vietnamese-made pictures that had not yet gone up on the walls
and which, like the Vietnamese furniture, would come from the same people who
supplied the Park Hyatt Saigon hotel, in Ho Chi Minh City. Mr Stoll asked me
if I liked the â€˜open planâ€™ of the suite. My wife had no hesitation,
saying, â€˜I would like to live in a house like this.â€™ Between the bed and
the bath was a gigantic pedestal with two white, bowl-style basins on it and a
round, swivel mirror between them. I thought of my grandfatherâ€™s portable
shaving stand, made of wood, round, with two flap-top lockers for the soap
bowl and blaireau and a mirror in the middle. Either end of the bath were the
toilet and shower, in translucent-glass compartments. Inside these the walls
were of milky-brown limestone, polished less where it was necessary for the
feet to get a grip.

**Above : **The front of the Indochina Palace, Hue

In the niches in the shower and bath walls and on the great pedestal stood
talismans of the Indochine Palace, the celadon containers for bathing
requisites, with stainless-steel, pump-operating heads. On string-of-pearl-
like stainless-steel chains the bottles wore stainless-steel labels, like
long, flat ingot pendants, that clinked richly. The preparations, at least
some seeming to be of the hotelâ€™s own invention, included a very fine,
reddish liquid soap with a piquant aroma. It was understandable that Mme was
inclined to pump as if she were at an oracle or an oil well. The open plan as
it applied between the desk/sitting area and the bed/bath area was controlled
across the middle of the suite with an ingenious, fixed, multi-layered,
lattice-like, acoustic screen and sliding acoustic screens of glass. Each side
had its own large, flat television unit, and Mme would have been able to watch
a Vietnamese quiz show while I watched cricket or Nineteen Eighty Four, the
older version. Hue outside and the inside of the Indochine Palace suite, or
open plan, were joined by both sliding, white, wooden, ceiling-to-floor panels
of louvres and, closer to the glass, broad, vertically running blinds, one for
each half of the suite, that admitted a rich, sunrise-coloured glow in the
morning, this complementing the warmth of the browns of the decor.

â€˜Celadonâ€™ is, according to Oxford, willow green, also a glaze of a colour
like that of young willow bark, and a kind of pottery with this glaze. The
colour is named after a character in a 17th-century French pastoral romance,
according Oxford, and Mr Stoll outlined a story, involving clothing of this
colour on a blade by the name of Celadon. Vietnamese enterprises generally
defer to an impersonated cultural ancestry, and the pictures at the altar in
the Indochine Palaceâ€™s case would be of the last Emperor, Bao Dai, and his
consort (and queen) Nam Phuong. Bao Dai was apparently a talented, stylish,
occupant of the throne from 1926 to 1945, and according to a small book picked
up at the Hue airport his plans for a constitutional monarchy were thwarted by
the French colonial government, so that, discouraged, he devoted himself
totally to hunting and sports.* Mr Stoll envisaged Queen Nam Phuong descending
the lobby staircases, the balustrades of which seemed to emulate the lines of
the low walls of a certain area of moats in the royal domain of Hue, or Phu
Van Lau. A lot of trouble was gone to to get these lines right at the
Indochine Palace. If you look level before you as you approach the ascent, you
will see the result. In this also is the Indochine Palace a landmark and
â€˜not just another hotelâ€™. It is an advance on the genre. These regal
accoutrements do not rule out deference to modern Vietnam, and Mr Stoll was
considering a prestigious place in the finished hotel for a full roll-out of
the nationâ€™s modern genii.

The Indochine Palace must be one of Vietnamâ€™s biggest
architectural/conceptual undertakings. It looks small enough in the royal-
proportioned landscape of the Perfume River, but it was enormous on our tour
of it with Mr Stoll and the General Manager, Mr Matthias Wiesmann, in whose
office sleek, black-to-white-toned precision was balanced with the colour and
light of a Rolex-quality box shrine on the floor. The creation of the
Indochine Palace has entailed extreme difficulty, but not such as to stop Mr
Stoll, the former cook from Germany who fell in love and fell in love with
hoteliery at the same time. His advice might be, â€˜Put forward your dream and
see who wants to share in it.â€™ Those who have glimpsed the dream have been
impressed by the size of the financial investment in it, which must depend on
the clarity of its exposition. Vietnam Heritage has received publicity to the
effect that â€˜the former Celadon Palace Hotelâ€™ has been â€˜re-branded as
Best Western Premier Indochine Palace (BWP Indochine Palace) from 1 October
2011â€™. It must be nearly two years since we stayed, and I understand that
the only substantial change to my description â€“ which has dealt with the
physical only, as such is the importrance of the physical in this case â€“
might follow from the fact that now all the paintings are up. The â€˜open
planâ€™, with celadon flasks so appealing to a modern consort, and the
profoundly palatial fittings and objects, things a viewing of which is hard to
put a price on, are still there. The price of a stay is exceptional value. The
Indochine Palace challenges the conventional view that guests go not to a
hotel but to a destination. In important respects it matches the old imperial
capital and is a fair representation of it in a modern way.n

_

On the eastern, or windward, side of the headland from which the fishing
village Mui Ne derives its name, on a wide sweeping bay with a mile or so of
sandy beach and standing in well tended gardens, you will find the Muine Bay
Resort, which celebrates its first birthday this month. Whilst the fishing
village cum suburb of Phan Thiet city is beginning to earn a reputation for
brash mass tourism, the Muine Bay Resort is a place to escape crowds and
luxuriate in peace and tranquillity with first-class-cuisine, at a reasonable
price.  
Unless you have access to a helicopter, getting there from Ho Chi Minh City
will not be quick. For me, however, thanks to the services of Sinh Travel, it
was at least made easy. When I was told I would be travelling by minibus an
image of my sitting wedged with zero leg space between two old ladies each
with a basket full of chickens on her lap and cigarette smoke from the driver
wafting into my lungs came into my mind. Thankfully Sinhâ€™s spankingly new
and bright twenty-five-seater was a small, rather than a mini-, bus. Service
both on and off board was impeccable. There were boarding announcements and a
pre-departure check to make sure exactly where you needed to be dropped off.
The fare, at just VND100,000 ($4.76), was amazing value for money.  
At a pit stop on the journey I got chatting to a pair of middle-aged Dutch
women. They remarked how dismal the scenery was. True, we had been passing by
the dark satanic mills and dull townlets of the city suburbs and Dong Nai
Province. â€˜It will be worth it when you get there,â€™ I assured them, â€˜and
we will soon be in the green pleasant and hilly land of Binh Thuan
Province.â€™ By then sadly night had fallen but I was able to please the
ladies by pointing out the sight of fields of dragon fruit (pitaya) lit up by
electric light bulbs to encourage early maturation.  
After six-and-half hours we rolled into a very long, glitzy street with an
endless row of restaurants, hotels and shops with neon lights that were
predominantly in Russian, for Mui Ne was already famous in Moscow. A look of
horror came on the face one of the Dutch ladies and she blurted out the single
word â€˜Benidormâ€™, a synonym among Northern Europeans for tasteless, over-
developed tourism. Secondly she said â€˜Stripâ€™, in reference to vulgar Las
Vegas. I left them for something completely different on the final leg of my
journey, a ten-minute taxi ride to the Muine Bay Resort.  
Soon I was being shown my room. The de-luxe, brightly whitewashed sea-view
room ($145 per night) was finely furnished with carved, darkly polished
furniture in the Cham style. [Champa is a civilisation that existed in
present-day Central Vietnam into the middle of the second millennium AD.
Nowadays the Cham people are one of Vietnamâ€™s many â€˜ethnic minoritiesâ€™.]
On the sea-facing balcony there was a small ladder. â€˜Wellâ€™, I exclaimed to
the room boy, â€˜this is hardly going to help in case of fireâ€™ and I dangled
it over the side to demonstrate the inadequacy of the object. The general
manager laughed when I told him about this the following day. It was not a
ladder, he told me, but a drying-rack. The local people in particular needed
something to hang their smalls out to dry on.  
The room boy left a little perplexed and I looked out on the balcony in awe at
the star-spangled heavens. Invisible in the city but here in greeting were
long lost chums: Orion, the Plough and Polaris, the North Star; and I spotted,
right above my head, a â€˜starâ€™ that did not twinkle, Jupiter maybe. Strong,
fresh sea breezes were blowing healthy ozone into my lungs. Out in the wide
and beautiful gardens the palms were swaying. It was now the windy season and
for these three days I was to experience the exhilaration of a high wind, or a
number seven on Mr Beaufortâ€™s scale. Whole trees were in motion and a
moderate amount of spray was being thrown over the barrier bushes by the sea
at high tide the following day. Very special atmospheric weather this was! It
put me in mind of the slogan for the English seaside town of Skegness, exposed
as it is to the North Sea winds, â€“ â€˜So bracing!â€™  
There was a restaurant in the main building but everyone was taking meals at
the thatched Beachside Restaurant. I tried both Vietnamese and Western dishes
and found them all delicious and very reasonably priced, given this is an
isolated, high-end hotel with a captive clientele.  
I ate a very fine seafood pizza (Neptune) with a rather crunchy, thin crust,
for VND185,000 ($8.81). I created my own fusion food by mixing Phan Thiet fish
sauce into a Russian salad that comprised peas, carrots and potato covered in
mayonnaise. Quite interesting. I had a cream of tomato soup concocted to
perfection (VND125,000 ($5.95)) and for the first time tasted fillet of black
king fish â€˜a la florentineâ€™, which is baked with a cheese crust in a cream
sauce with spinach. It was, as they might say in Firenze itself,
â€˜Perfetto!â€™ (VND355,000 ($16.90)).  
The Vietnamese food came at lower prices. The two dishes I tried were the
braised tuna in a clay pot packed with the flavour of a black pepper and chili
sauce and the ginger chicken in small pieces on the bone. I had both
accompanied with plain white rice and my favourite vegetable, morning glory.  
Whilst the wine list was extensive, only three canned beer brands were
available (from VND30,000 ($1.43) a can). I long for the day when fresh
draught beer becomes more readily available in Vietnam. There was, however, a
list of nineteen cocktails and a few mocktails, including â€˜Phan Thiet
Mocktailâ€™, a mixture of dragon fruit, papaya and mango juices. Feeling
adventurous, I tried a â€˜Golden Dreamâ€™ consisting of Galliano, Cointreau,
orange juice and cream (VND85,000 ($4.05)) â€“ A fine drink and one I am sure
the ladies would appreciate.  
I had a long talk with the general manager, Mr Nguyen Van Khoa. He explained
that one of the aims of the resort was to introduce guests to Cham culture.
This is reflected in the architecture, in the clay pottery ornaments in some
of the rooms and the laterite stone carvings of apsaras (dancing girls) on
some of the walls. Excursions to a Cham village and the famous Cham towers of
Phan Thiet, with a cultural show thrown in, can be arranged. On certain days
Cham cuisine is served in the restaurant.  
Mr Khoa also commented that the explosive expansion of tourism in Mui Ne had
not been accompanied by an adequate growth in available trained staff. The
English-language level of the staff was, overall, quite low. The staff are
also sometimes not quite used to the quirkiness of Westerners. I tried to get
mustard for the bacon and sausages at the buffet breakfast and even though I
used the Vietnamese words â€˜mÃ¹ táº¡câ€™ I ended up with wasabe. This is a
perfectly acceptable substitute for an Englishman but maybe not for the French
and Germans, who like their mustard sweet. All this is more than compensated
for, however, by the natural friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.
Moreover, if, like me, you are concerned that your tourist dollar will go to
the benefit of the local people, this is the place for you. The resort is
owned by the Ben Thanh Tourist company and the personnel is 100 per cent from
Binh Thuan Province itself, with many recruited from the nearby village.  
For my second night I transferred to a Seaview Bungalow ($235 a night). This
came with its own verandah, a spacious bathroom and even a small garden
featuring bougainvillea, stretizelia and cacti. I was also shown the family
rooms. The Family Seaview Room ($215) had a private sleeping area for the
children upstairs. The Grand Family Room converted the downstairs into a salon
and had an adjoining room for a second couple.  
Apart from relaxing in a deckchair there are plenty of activities at this
resort. Firstly there is the beach. In the calm season you can go kayaking or
take a short boat ride out to Lao Islet (HÃ²n Lao). There is a shrine temple
on it which commemorates a hero who saved people from a shipwreck. Now, in the
windy season, with white horses cantering to shore, conditions were ideal for
wind- and kite-surfing. I watched as devotees leaped ten metres into the air.
Unlike the skateboarding fraternity, they never seem to fall into the water.  
Anyone for tennis? The hard courts here even have high chairs for umpires. If
you do not like to swim in the ocean there is a huge kidney-shaped pool. If
you need a drink there is no need even to get out of the water as there are
stone chairs in it alongside the bar. A spa was due to open in the near
future, Mr Khoa informed me. I also enjoyed just wandering in the landscaped
gardens. By the pond, the electric blue bolt, unmistakeably of the common
kingfisher (Alcedo alcedo), shot by me. I took this as an omen that I would
look back on my time here as â€˜halcyon daysâ€™, the halcyon being a mythical
bird [â€˜charming the wind and waves into calmâ€™ â€“ Oxford] as well as a
real tropical kingfisher.  
Enveloped in warm and natural Vietnamese hospitality and surrounded by nature
and grounds lovingly tended by man, the Muine Bay Resort is both â€˜So
bracing!â€™ and â€˜So embracing!â€™

T he northeastern province of Bac Giang is known for its cool year-round. One
weekend, my friends and I decided to visit Dong Cao Village, in Thach Son
Commune, in the provinceâ€™s Son Dong District.  
At 8 a.m., our bus left Bac Giang Town and headed northeast. It covered almost
90 kilometres before taking us to the centre of Thach Son Commune.  
The road was rough, with stones exposed by a heavy rain the night before. The
bus stopped in Dong Bam Village, some five kilometres from Dong Cao. We would
have to cross a forest.  
We borrowed four motorcycles from the village but none of us was courageous
enough to drive. We asked the local young men for help. Half of us went on
foot.  
Dong Cao Village has 24 households of the ethnic group Dao, living in the
middle of a cloudy valley. Not many people know about the village, partly
beacuse of the remoteness and dangerous roads.  
A young man called Thang, not Dao but of the Cao Lan tribe, took me on his bad  
motorcycle uphill and downhill and round some sharp bends.  
â€˜The roads are bad, so we would not ride a good motorcycle even if we had
oneâ€™, Thang said. â€˜We always have to get our motorcycles repaired after a
trip like this.â€™

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Map-Vietnam2.jpg)

We visited Trieu Tien Thoong, a 72-year-old Dao man. After pouring a cup of a
tea-like drink for me, Thoong said, â€˜It was desolate here in the past, with
a lot of trees and dangerous wild animals. A few years ago, people began to
have an idea of growing speciality vegetables and raising cows for milk but it
is not clear why they havenâ€™t carried out the plan.â€™  
The countryâ€™s electricity grid hasnâ€™t reached the area and there is a
limited amount of farmland. Irrigation is difficult. Thoong said rice-
production and forest-exploitation did not provide enough food for the locals.
â€˜We are-half-a-dayâ€™s walk from the market [Van Son Market], so we go to
the market a couple of times a month to buy some necessities like salt,
paraffin and flashlights,â€™ he said.  
Even on the warmest summer nights, people have to use blankets.  
Thoong showed us a place called Hang Vua (Kingâ€™s Cave) where there is a
vertical cliff in the middle of a forest and a stream. The place is
breathtakingly beautiful. It is not clear why the Dao people here call it Hang
Vua. Thoong  
couldnâ€™t give an explanation.  
Walking up King Mountain (NÃºi Vua), we strolled on green grass in the middle
of a plateau, with bushes and wild plants in flower here and there in mist,
and we could hear some footsteps of buffaloes.  
Picking wild gooseberries and putting them into his mouth, Luyen, a member of
our party, looked as if he had never done such a thing before.  
Under layers of clouds, we lay on the grass and took the cool air through the
skin.  
We discovered an area with huge rocks of different shapes on a hill. The rocks
were side by side, creating a nice shape as if they had been arranged by human
beings. We decided to stay, watching the sun go down behind a hill, where
smoke rose from a house roof.n

Hoi An during a flood in 2007.  
Photo: Truong Dien Thang

In 1994, an Englishwoman, Maria Coffey, and her husband travelled Vietnam by
boat and bicycle, prompted by the nostalgia of a Vietnamese friend. In a book
called Three Moons in Vietnam, published in 1996, Coffey wrote, â€˜Hoi An
looks like a sleepy suburb with historic houses full of mulberries in dense
foliage.â€™ Despite big changes in much of Vietnam, Hoi An retains today much
of the quiet and meditative feel Coffey found.  
In the old quarter, houses face the street and its fish-skeleton alleys head
toward the quietly flowing Hoai River*. The old houses were built mostly by
the Chinese and Japanese. They are wooden, with roofs covered with â€˜maleâ€™
and â€˜femaleâ€™ tiles and cemented with mortar and molasses. Thanks to the
organic component, grasses and mosses flourish on the roofs.  
The â€˜eyeâ€™ above the door in front of each house, imposing as a protecting
god, is there to prevent the house-owner from disasters [these eyes have not
stopped the old quarter being flooded badly in recent years, perhaps because
of deforestation upstream â€“ Ed.] and misfortunes. The eyes are square,
circular, octagonal or a bat (in Vietnamese, â€˜batâ€™, dÆ¡i, the animal, also
means â€˜fortuneâ€™). They are all cleaned for the lunar new year, when the
residents drape them in a red cloth.  
The World Heritage historic houses usually have two storeys, three sections, a
narrow hall running sometimes from one street to another and an inner court
with a light well in the middle section that is not roofed. The house usually
shares a side wall or both with next door.  
In the central well is a somewhat miniaturised garden, a tree with foliage for
shade, a walking path and furniture that expresses serenity. It is starkly
different from the busy, noisy, business front of the house. The owner also
has a room next to the central well and an altar and meeting space.  
The main streets of the old town, such as Nguyen Thai Hoc, Tran Phu, Bach Dang
and Le Loi are, have houses on average 150 years old. Floods of tourists are a
blemish on the original charm of the Hoi An old quarter, but, until recently
at least, have not effaced it.  
I have heard it said that the main streets are reserved for families of rich
merchants who are descendants of the Chinese and Japanese businesspeople of
old times and only the alleys belong to the native people of recent
generations.  
The indentations in the lines of buildings at the street are to help winds
wander in the alley and mingle with water vapour from a dozen old water wells
near the road, to give natural fresh air to every home.  
The water wells have various forms, primarily square or circular, or are
square and circle combined. This multiplicity is a result of the interplay of
several cultures: the square well comes from Champa, the circular from China
and Vietnam. One well is built with bricks and another with stones, but none
uses mortar. A frame of ironwood is placed base to keep the well stable.  
All the ancient wells here have altars to their goddesses, under whose
protection, after hundreds of years, the water remains particularly sweet and
unspoiled. Its quality appears in Hoi An cuisine.  
Dishes offered in renowned restaurants include cao láº§u (Japanese-style dry
noodle soup) and fragrant mÃ¬ Quáº£ng (Quáº£ng Nam-style noodle soup with rice
cake). Other items such as bÃ¡nh bÃ¨o (steamed round or flat rice cakes) and
bÃ¡nh váº¡c (fried patties) with fried scallions and oily flour can often be
seen on the bamboo poles of women peddlers.  
Visitors note greetings of â€˜helloâ€™ or words of welcome from the water-
sellers at the wells or the clicking of the bamboo sticks of noodle peddlers
at night, though they are rarer these days.  
The alleys that lead to the Hoai River, where there is fresh air and where
they dispose of rain and used water, stand, in spite of the ravages of
seasonal floods caused by monsoons. [From this it would appear that the alleys
were built down to the river in full knowledge that they would be ravaged. â€“
Ed.]  
There is a saying in the old quarter that:  
â€˜Forgiven by the male river god but not by the goddess/ Another flood on the
23rd of the 10th month comesâ€™ (Ã”ng tha mÃ bÃ cháº³ng tha/ Láº¡i thÃªm cÃ¡i
lá»¥t hÄƒm ba thÃ¡ng 10).  
Water rushes through the streets and into the houses, penetrating imposing old
buildings. The people are surprised not by the floods but by the high levels
of the water reaches.  
The flood of 1946, with a high mark of 2.5 metres and numerous devastations
and disasters, returned in 1999. The commonly-thought cycle of 40 years for
great floods is no longer true. In 2007 the flood surpassed records and
submerged the lowlands of the entire province, Quáº£ng Nam.  
Tourists come from all directions to observe the Hoi An floods. One of their
pastimes has been to sit in small boats, floating along the streets, revelling
in the calmness of the residents.  
Originating in the Sa Huá»³nh culture 2,000 years ago, prospering as the old
Linyi Town of the Cham people and seaport of Hoi An affluent during the time
of the Nguyen overlords four centuries ago, the old quarter of Hoi An today
contains not only relics and marks of its history but a sense of flexing and
accommodating continuation.  
If the Thu Bon River had not changed its course, we might have expected today
a Hoi An noisy and dirty, a city with skyscrapers and an ambitious, nervous
population. This is not Hoi Anâ€™s long-acquired character.n

11/20/2019,Barter at the foot of a plum tree,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/barter-at-the-foot-of-a-plum-tree/,,Text and photos by Hang Nga,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Ban-dua-gan-ben-duong-vao-C.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DSC_0283-By-Hang-Nga-19x12-.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Lam-dieu-mot-chut-truoc-chu.jpg,"![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Ban-dua-gan-ben-duong-vao-C.jpg)

( _No.1, Vol.2, Jan 2012 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

At noon, the market was over. The Hmong women left the market for home with
weary steps, their feet _wearing Chinese plastic shoes. On the way to the
parking place, I met a Dao woman who was trying to hold the handles of her
basket with some empty plastic containers hanging loosely, her merchandise
having been sold away, and her basket was also empty. Her other hand was
holding her horseâ€™s bridle, a man who might be her husband was dead drunk
with his neck twisted, his whole body lying overbearingly on the horse moving
back and forth at each step of the horse.  
At 9 a.m., I arrived at the market day Coc Ly, located a dozen kilometres from
Bac Ha District, Lao Cai Province in the north west. It took me nearly one
hour and a half to reach it, because I had to ride my motorbike very slowly on
the pebbled road and at the same time stop to ask for the way to the market.
According local people, Coc Ly means the foot of a plum tree. Bac Ha is famous
for plum trees. In the spring, the forest is all white with plum flowers,
ethereal and brilliant, looking indistant in the screen of white mist as if it
were woven with heavenly silk dotted with white flowers, hanging loosely over
a young girlâ€™s shoulder.  
Most people in this area live in the mountainous region dozens of kilometres
from the market. Therefore in order to get to the market in time for the
market day, they have to leave home very early, at 2 or 3 a.m., mostly on foot
or on horseback. If I were given a choice among the traditional market days of
the ethnic people in Lao Cai, such as the Bac Ha, the Can Cau, the Coc Ly
market, I would pick Coc Ly as the best …  
As compared to the Love Market at Khau Vai in Sapa, which has been changed
into a commercialized city owing to tourism, all three markets Bac Ha, Can Cau
and Coc Ly (met respectively on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday) remain traditional
ones that have not been commercialized.  
However I like to talk about Coc Ly where money doesnâ€™t seem to count, since
some people sometimes go to the market and get back home with a basket full
with groceries without spending one cent. At the market, beside selling home-
prepared maize alcohol, specialties picked in the forest such as bamboo
shoots, mushrooms, bee honey, and buffalo meat, horse meat, pork, and chickens
… people go to the market just to meet people for talks or make friends with
new people. At Coc Ly market people can come to barter a buffalo for a horse,
five chickens for a pig, some detergent for a basket of hot pepper, or some
cucumber … Of course people still use money. A Hmong girl about eight spread a
piece of canvas on the ground, on which a few bunches of wild berries were
displayed for sale for VND1,000 ($0.05) a bunch that weighed as much as one
kilogram each. In order to pick as many as 20 bunches of wild berries, she and
her brother had to walk around in the forest the whole day yesterday. At 5
a.m. this morning she had to walk over two hills to the market. Next to her
â€˜merchandiseâ€™ was the shop of cheap multicoloured Chinese candy and
cookies owned by a Dao woman. The wild berries were not attractive for the
Tay, Dao, Hmong women at the market, they swarmed up to buy and eat the
multicoloured snacks.  
On the right corner, the ethnic women were competing with each other to have a
photo taken for souvenir. They were combing their hair shyly waiting for their
turn to be called by the photographer to have their photo taken. A piece of
discoloured cloth was hung on the wattle for the background for the camera
shots. I had to stand a little far away from the scene or else these girls
would feel embarrassed and run away.  
Coc Ly offers such nice items as brocade bags, silver wristlets, or nice-
looking earrings made by the ethnic minority people. I found out that the
price the tourists paid for these items at Coc Ly was much lower than at the
other markets. A brocade bag costs VND80,000 ($3.81) at the Sapa market would
cost only VND25,000 ($1.19) at Coc Ly market. For a pair of silver earrings
that costs VND20,000 ($0.95) at the Sapa market, the tourists would pay only
VND8,000 ($0.38) at Coc Ly market. Ly Ping, a Tay ethnic woman who sells
batteries, detergent, insecticide, VCD, rope, boots, etc …, is counting her
money. I asked if she had made any profit, she said she had made VND15,000
($0.71) since early in the morning.  
What surprises me is that this ethnic woman is very clear and logic in
calculating. Ly Ping added, â€˜I get the merchandise from the Chinese, not
from the Vietnamese lowlanders, which is very expensiveâ€™.  
At noon when the sun was at its zenith, everybody swarmed up to the camp to
eat â€˜tháº¯ng cá»‘â€™ and drink maize alcohol. â€˜Tháº¯ng cá»‘â€™ is the
traditional dish of the Hmong ethnic people. The ingredients used to cook
â€˜tháº¯ng cá»‘â€™ consist of a cowâ€™s, a buffaloâ€™s, a horseâ€™s or a
pigâ€™s heart and liver, intestine, blood, meat, bones, etc … All these items
would be put together in a big pot and cooked until they have become well-
done, then some green vegetables and onion can be added. They eat while the
food is still being cooked. Many women also enjoy eating the â€˜tháº¯ng
cá»‘â€™ as much as men. But they do not drink as much.  
It would be a great joy for the Dao, the Tay, the Hmong men to be able to go
to the market to sell a pig, buy a buffalo, eat a â€˜tháº¯ng cá»‘â€™ meal and
drink maize alcohol at Coc Ly market. The women would be more interested in
beautiful skirts. They would get a skirt that costs as much as VND500,000
($23.80) if their husbands can sell a horse for three or five million dongs.  
To get to Coc Ly market one can either go by land from Bac Ha or take a boat
trip on Chay river, cross Bao Nhai bridge and walk about three kilometres.n

The sentiments of the poet Henly are mine too â€“ â€˜the passing of the years
finds and leaves me unafraidâ€™. I may be too young to worry. I am just fifty
six. Yet I believe my skin looks younger than its years. My strategy so far
has been simple. I exercise regularly, wash in soap and water and eat a daily
ration of extra-virgin olive oil.  
Cities in general will wear one down. Ho Chi Minh City in particular must be
at the top of the league for this. With its noise, pollution and the
motorbikes constantly at your backside even when you are innocently walking on
the pavement this a tiring place indeed. Small wonder then that this is
fertile territory for enterprises offering to ease your weary body with a
massage. There are so many of them. In one downtown street, indeed, you are
met every five metres by a girl thrusting a leaflet and shouting â€˜Massaâ€™
in your ear. You know what they mean. They are not inviting you to meet Filipe
the famous Brazilian Formula One driver.  
Up market places offering these services use the word â€˜spaâ€™ to describe
themselves, which also has strong Formula One connotations. One of the largest
of these and one offering a wide range of formulae for renewal and relaxation
as well as normal hairdressing services is V Spa. It has been around for eight
years although under its present management for only one, during which it has
opened up a branch on touristy Le Thanh Ton Street. I went to its main branch
housed in a rambling villa off relatively quiet Phung Khac Khoan Street also
in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City using a VIP card given to me by the Editor-
in-Chief of Vietnam Heritage that allowed me to have some services for free.  
Lying on your back on a couch for over an hour and staring through a circular
hole at a bowl of water with lotus flowers it may not sound enthralling. But
believe you me when you are unaware which part of your body will next come
under attention for a pummeling, pounding or a stretching, you keep alert at
every moment almost as much as I did in the bunker of our compound in
Afghanistan when it came under rocket attack.  
After around half an hour Miss Thy my masseuse rubbed in an anti-ageing cream
all over my body. The secret of this, purportedly, is that it contains fresh
caviar. However, there is no need to worry about contributing to the
extinction of the Caspian sturgeon, as the â€˜caviarâ€™ in question is salmon
roe. All the ointments and unctions used at V Spa are imported from France.  
Next it was time for the application of hot stones. They were placed along my
spine and were just at the right temperature â€“ hot but not too so. Miss Thy
uses them to very soothing effect, rubbing them carefully over what seems to
be all the right acupuncture points.  
After well over an hour it was time to turn face up for the second treatment
â€“ a facial. Patiently, my masseuseâ€™s delicate fingers got to work on every
part of my face, beginning with the skull. She even spent a good ten minutes
massaging my eyelids.  
Suddenly things started to get scary as Miss Thy wheeled in a machine that
looked like a miniature crane the like of which I last saw at the dentistâ€™s.
Then she donned a surgeonâ€™s mask. What had I let myself in for? Was she
going to start pulling teeth or was it her evil intent to trepan my skull? I
started to wish I was back in the relative safety of the Kabul bunker.  
The pistol-like rod of the appaartus was pointed at my forehead. There was a
tense moment of suspense but nothing more sinister happened than the blowing
of hot air over my face. Miss Thy then rubbed in the â€˜caviarâ€™ cream over
my face and after a long while removed it with little swabs over her fingers.  
As a grand finale to the three-hour act, my eyes were covered with a gauze
face mask. A cream was applied over this, sweetly smelling of peaches and
papaya. I lay blindfolded for a full half hour while my face and body were
massaged again. Finally the mask was removed and out came the finger swabs
again.  
If you had been wondering about what goes on in these places, dear reader,
there you have it. My body had been well toned up and spirits reinvigorated.
Rejuvenated? Well I can tell you I left V Spa not feeling a day over fifty
seven.n

**Vietnam Heritage, November-December 2011 Advertorial —** Not so far from the
madding crowd but definitely well away from it, hidden in a cove at the remote
end of a peninsula, lies the An Lam Ninh Van Bay all-villa resort. From it you
can actually see the northern extremity of Nha Trang City across the wider
bay, so near but thankfully so far away. The only access to it is from the
sea, or, if you prefer, a hard dayâ€™s trek along a track over mountains that
tower above it to the nearest proper road and village. Those who seek a beach
and jungle holiday in total seclusion but with tip-top accommodation with food
and beverage to match need look no further. Here you may either lie back on
your daybed and pursue a life of relaxation and meditation or participate in a
variety of activities including trekking, fishing, snorkelling, cruising the
bay and sailing.  
My Vietnamese wife and I took the night sleeper train from Ho Chi Minh City,
which is quite a good alternative to the plane. For one thing it takes you to
the heart of Nha Trang City, which is much closer to the final destination.
The airport is far to the south and an hourâ€™s drive away from the resortâ€™s
mainland jetty. We slept quite well. The last half hour was in the daylight
and we awoke to find outside the window a dream world of egrets winging across
paddies and stretches of forest before the train trundled through the suburbs
and reached the station. Already the pace of life seemed a couple of gears
down from frenetic Saigon. Our mission of spending a couple of days together
in tranquillity was well on its way now.  
There to meet us was the resortâ€™s representative, who ushered us into a
luxury car for the twenty-five minute journey to their waterfront facilities
and mainland jetty. The trip took us alongside the cityâ€™s famous beaches,
where early birds were having their morning dip and on past the famous PoNagar
Cham Towers, along a new and largely empty road. At the fishing village of Tan
Thanh we reached the resortâ€™s mainland foothold.  
After executing some business we had deferred from the train, namely a wash
and brush up and a trip to a spanking clean loo, we settled down to a welcome
drink. This facility doubles as the reception for the resort and we filled in
the simple registration form as well giving our preferences for music, food
and drink and activities. We were also asked what level of butler service we
required. Having brought along my own girl Friday, my wife, I set this at low.  
There had been some talk in Vietnamese between my wife and the representative
about having to cross over by canoe. I had visions of being asked to help
paddle our way over â€“ I who had failed to make it into the college rowing
team. Fears were allayed as I now discovered by some almighty semantic shift
canoe in Vietnamese means speedboat. And off we sped like James Bond on a
mission with the resort staff welcoming and waving us on from their own boat.
It took just eight minutes. The morning mist hang poetically in the mountains
and even on parts of the sea. We waved hello, as we went, to men out on
artisanal fishing, standing up in their tiny launches and basket boats.  
At the resortâ€™s pier we were met and welcomed by the management and
introduced to our butler, Miss Hai. She led us to the only motorised vehicle,
a â€˜buggyâ€™ which took us to our villa. Outside the bamboo fence was a
tandem bicycle for our personal use. The villa itself was down a short garden
path. To the front was a swimming pool and a sundeck area overlooking a lagoon
with sandbanks of the beach ahead and the open sea. They had taken heed of the
preference form already, as my favourite Latin music was playing on the
entertainment system, which also included 35 TV channels and all kinds of in-
house movies. To the rear we had an open-air bathtub as well as inside and
outside showers. Inside the airy rooms two swings hung from the roof. There
was an area for coffee and tea-making and the fridge was stocked with sixteen
kinds of grape wine. The garden was well planned and made to be an extension
of the jungle. It attracted bees and butterflies and the following morning we
awoke to birdsong.  
Later that morning we were taken on a tour of the resort by Mr Yamany. He
hails from the Maldives, a country great in experience of the luxury end of
tourism. He showed us the gardens with herbs and vegetables for the resort as
well as a mango and sapodilla orchard.  
Next, we were shown the classroom/kitchen for cookery lessons. Then we went to
the library stocked with mainly pictorial books to help explain the nature and
fauna and flora that surrounds you here and in Vietnam in general. The tour
also included viewing of the five classes of villa. On the rocks up wooden
staircases are little villa nests intended for honeymooners. We did notice
several young couples on the beach during our stay. I could personally
recommend this also for second honeymooners. We are in our mid-fifties but I
can I can tell you the place had quite a rejuvenating effect on my wife. But
we wonâ€™t delve into that. The other villas are aimed at various family
types. The largest for an extended family stay was $700 per night, Mr Yamany
explained to us.  
An interesting detail my wife spotted on the tour was that lemongrass is
planted in front of each villa. â€˜Thisâ€™ she said and Mr Yamany confirmed
it, â€˜is an effective repellent for garden snakes.â€™ If you have that
irrational but very human fear of serpents you need fear not here. We were not
bothered by mosquitoes either, but you sleep under netting and repellent and
incense coils are provided just in case.  
The food at An Lam Ninh Van Bay Villas is superb. The Vietnamese food we tried
mainly at breakfast. My wife, who used to run a restaurant herself and who has
been described by another contributor to this magazine as â€˜Madame
Epicureâ€™, was highly impressed by the Beef Pho, Banh Cuon and the Banh Canh
Cha Ca (kinds of Rice Cake Rolls). I opted for western food, as I normally eat
only Vietnamese, but had quite a reverse culture shock at lunch. The sea bass
came nouvelle-cuisine-style. Actually it looked quite a picture, garnished
with carrot puree and a brown sauce and framed by the large square plate it
was presented on. But, living a Vietnamese life, I am no longer used to a
round steak of fish. Iâ€™ll make no fish bones about it. For me fish has to
have a head, a body and a tail; not necessarily in that order. And I am not
used to seeing fish so dressed up. Having first swallowed my prejudice, the
catch of the day was superbly delicious, and such a change it made not having
to worry about having a bone stuck in your throat!  
Dinner also was a memorable experience, with meditative and swaying Samba
music in the background keeping in time with the lapping of the sea waves. I
went the whole, three-course hog. Cream of pumpkin soup with coconut milk
proved a great entree. For the â€˜piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistanceâ€™ I had grilled New
Zealand lamb with couscous (steamed semolina). I went for the low-calorie
fruit selection for dessert, having â€˜sinnedâ€™ at lunch by eating
scrumptious lemon cheesecake with rasperry ice-cream. Here I have to point to
an amusing error in English on the menu. â€˜Mint mouseâ€™ is actually quite
possible in a country like Vietnam but they meant â€˜Mint Mousseâ€™.  
The following morning, after a champagne breakfast featuring scrambled eggs
with salmon in the mix, we went on a two-hour sailing cruise of the bay, just
the two of us. The weather was sunny with bright blue skies. They had to run
the engines slowly as it was such a perfect day there was no breeze. Our
guide, a knowledgeable and seasoned salt named Sang, offered more sparkling
wine on board but we declined in favour of fresh orange juice.  
We sailed along the peninsula around the islands of Hon Thi and Dao Khi, with
its monkey colony. Then it was out almost to the open sea to Hon Cha La, where
the salangane or swiflet saliva for birdâ€™s-nest soup is harvested â€“ a Nha
Trang speciality. From here the nearest village, Ninh Van, was in view in the
near distance, with its enticing long, sandy beach.  
Back to the villa for some more serious relaxation and then at four o â€˜clock
in the afternoon it was back on the speedboat for our return to Saigon
realities. The whole staff turned out on the jetty to bid us â€˜Háº¹n gáº·p
láº¡iâ€™. They seemed already like old friends although we had known them for
barely more than two days.  
Vietnam tourism has come long way since I came to live here fourteen years
ago. It still caters for and welcomes well visitors of all budget levels. But
at the top end of the market now it is truly world-class. For a beach and
jungle break in perfect calm and luxury (An LÃ¢m translates as â€˜forest
calmâ€™) there can be few places on the planet that equal the standards and
setting of An Lam Ninh Van Bay Villas.n

11/20/2019,Cave museums of Phong Nha,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/cave-museums-of-phong-nha/,,"By Annie Eagle, with pictures of Paradise Cave by Thai A",,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Map-Vietnam.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/hang2.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/hang3.jpg,"![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Map-
Vietnam.jpg)![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/hang2.jpg)

**Vietnam Heritage, November-December 2011 —** As I arrived by night after an
arduous mini-bus ride north from Danang, Phong Nha Farmstay was an array of
_coloured lanterns over the front porch of a French-colonial-style building.
Then it was a Jack Daniels sign hung over the bar and the trappings of a
western pub – pool, darts, rock music, a menu with a Western selection and a
fridge loaded with Mars bars. It would have appealed to tourists seeking the
familiar in an  
exotic location. There were plenty of people and a lively atmosphere.  
Phong Nha Farmstay is in Cu Nam village, Quang Binh Province, 35km from the
town of Dong Hoi near Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park. It looks out on rice
paddies with a mountain backdrop. The place opened last December and is run by
Ben, an Australian, Bich, his Vietnamese wife, and her extended family. When I
was there, it employed 15 people from Bichâ€™s family and the village.  
Ben, a jolly, ruddy-faced man in his forties, had lived in Vietnam for over
five years. Ben met Bich in Danang and they settled back at her home village
after a time in Australia and Dubai. He discovered the beauty of this area
exploring by bike and motorcycle. In conversation with me he recognized the
paradox of opening up a place of such remoteness. On the other hand, â€˜They
all want flush toilets and colour TVs.â€™  
As my cup of boiled water had black flecks in it, Ben threw it out and poured
another, which also had black flecks in it. He laughed. â€˜Itâ€™s well water
â€“ probably bits of stone. We dug 46m down. Everyone was jumping around in it
in glee as it sprayed around . . . Good water here â€“ pure, from up in the
mountains in Laos â€“ but we donâ€™t give it to tourists . . . Because if
anyone got sick, theyâ€™d blame the water.â€™  
Iâ€™d noticed a huge container of plastic bottles out back.  
Ben looked downcast, then said, â€˜We save all the bottles and the locals come
and buy them off us to use for rice wine or fish sauce. So at least they are
used twice, if not more . . .â€™  
What happens to the trash?  
â€˜The locals do two things with the trash: burn it or throw it in the
river.â€™  
I gave Ben and Bich literature on the dangers of plastic to health and the
environment and they were eager to read it. Ben wanted to make copies to
spread the word in the village, â€˜To save the riverâ€™.  
Ben said he had had shouting matches with the whole family about separating
the trash. There had been an issue about giving food waste to the neighbours
for the pigs. They would lose face receiving leftovers from rich Westerners.
Apparently he won his case.  
They also recycle olive jars by filling them with home-grown peppers for
parting gifts.  
I sampled a deliciously spicy tomato soup with hot bread and stir-fried
vegetables with oyster sauce. The service was good and Bich and her family
were a big, friendly presence.  
In a hammock on the porch, in the evening, I revelled in a warm breeze coming
across the rice paddies, with the songs of crickets and frogs. This was my
idea of farm-stay.  
There were ten rooms with ceiling fans and air-conditioning, for $25 to $35 a
night. Dorm beds were $8.  
My room was dominated by a four-poster bed with elegant lace mosquito netting
and I slept well on my two-night stay.  
On my first day, I joined two Australian families and others on a cycle ride
to Phong Nha Cave and the next day went on a tour to Phong Nha-Ke Bang
National Park, including a visit to Eight Lady Cave and the recently-opened
Paradise Cave. Farmstay also had just begun leading treks to the newly
discovered Son Doong Cave, now said to be the worldâ€™s largest cave.  
However, in future tours and treks were to be run by a new, Vietnamese
company, Oxalis Adventure Tours.  
On a train back south for Danang, I sipped from a flask of iced well water and
savoured its sweetness.  
  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/hang3.jpg)

The cave trip:  
From Phong Nha Farmstay, a group cycled through rice fields for 6 km or so to
Xuan Son Ferry, to take a boat down the River Son to Phong Nha Cave, one of
300 caves in the area. â€˜The karst formation of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National
Park has evolved since the Palaeozoic (some 400 million years ago) and so is
the oldest major karst area in Asia,â€™ a United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization document said. Karst consists of soluble
limestone, the compacted skeletons of marine organisms. This area, part of a
vast karst system from Thailand to south China, was once the bottom of the sea
and was pushed up by various geological events,  
UNESCO said. It is characterized by underground rivers, caves and sinkholes.  
The entrance to Phong Nha Cave, in the Phong Nha â€“ Ke Bang National Park, is
the last part of an underground river that connects with the Son River. The
cave is more than 7.7 kilometres long, according to a document from the park
management. Tour boats can penetrate 1,500 m, according to UNESCO.  
On our visit the boats docked at the entrance and tourists explored on foot.
In this enormous cavern, where the roof reached 83 metres high in places,
according to a park document, one could imagine that dragons once lived there.
The surface of one stone slab even resembled reptilian skin. Water has
dissolved calcium carbonate, oozed, dripped and rippled over eons, and
deposited calcium carbonate in huge stalactites and stalagmites and strange
formations with names like the â€˜Lionâ€™ and the â€˜Buddhaâ€™, which were now
under coloured lights.  
The boat cost $11 and took about 40 minutes; the cave entrance fee was
VND40,000 ($1.90).  
  
The park tour:  
Our tour of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park was conducted by an Australian,
Dave, who spent regular three-month periods at Farmstay. He had read a lot of
books on Vietnamese history, inspired by having befriended Vietnamese refugees
in his schooldays.  
His anecdotes included several personal stories from Bichâ€™s family. He was
an engaging storyteller, regaling us in the van and at various stops along the
way. I was impressed to see him dock his cigarettes underfoot and pocket the
butts – something I had never seen in Vietnam.  
Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park was declared in 2001 and in 2003 UNESCO listed
it World Heritage. It is 85,754 ha, according to a park document, bordering a
wildlife reserve in Laos.  
Ben told me the park, being on the border of the warm south and cold north and
having species endemic to only this region, had the highest biodiversity of
primates in Southeast Asia, nine species. [The park says it is home to nine of
21 primate species extant in Vietnam].  
Wildlife veterinarian Dr Ulrike Streicher has said that though there is high
biodiversity, populations are small and there are in fact very few monkeys.
Perhaps this is why she has funded the langur project at Camel Back Mountain,
in the park, with Cologne Zoo and Frankfurt Zoological Society.

The people in charge  
The forest and caves in the park are now open for sustainable tourism for a
limited number of people through Oxalis Adventure Tours.

Paradise Cave (Äá»™ng ThiÃªn ÄÆ°á»ng)  
Paradise Cave (Äá»™ng ThiÃªn ÄÆ°á»ng), inside Phong Nha-Ke Bang National
Park, was thought to be the largest cave in Asia until 2009, when another
cave, Hang Son Doong, also in this park, was credited as the worldâ€™s
largest.  
At 31.4 km, Paradise Cave is now known as the longest dry cave in Asia,
according to the British Royal Cave Association. The public are allowed only
1.1 kilometres into it, through a network of wooden steps, walkways and
bridges.  
Even grander than Phong Nha Cave, with a height of up to 100m and width of
150m, Paradise Cave presents the earthâ€™s inner landscapes of ossified sheets
of rain, cascades and curtains of rock and folds and furls of great skirts.
There are faces, animal shapes, mushroom domes, towers and spires, some with
textures of coral, others worn smooth as ice. We spent a good hour or two
inside, in a state of wonder. Time felt suspended.  
Eight Lady Cave  
According to the Peopleâ€™s Army Newspaper (QuÃ¢n Äá»™i NhÃ¢n DÃ¢n) of 17
May, 2009, one day in 1972 eight young volunteers were clearing a road near
Eight Lady Cave (Hang TÃ¡m CÃ´) when an air raid sounded. The volunteers ran
into the cave. A bomb landed, lodging a 100-tonne rock across the entrance.
Nine days later, people outside heard the volunteers for the last time. The
war ended that year and a temple was built near the cave to honour the eight
and others who died keeping the road, Road 20, open. In 1996 the Government
used explosives to remove the rock and found bones and hair.  
We entered the small temple to offer incense. It also served as a museum, with
possessions of the eight. Among them was a pair of â€˜Ho Chi Minh sandalsâ€™,
made from the Americansâ€™ old tyres and inner tubes.  
Dave said, â€˜The Vietnamese would cut out a sole from the tyre and use the
inner tube to tie it to their feet.â€™ A large plaque named those who had died
in the cave â€“ four women and four men.  
Hanging from a tree was half a bombshell that had been banged with a piece of
steel as an air-raid warning.  
In the late afternoon, we visited Nuoc Mooc (NÆ°á»›c Moá»c) swimming hole on
the River Chay. A 1.8km track led to it through jungle. The Vietnamese, funded
by Germany, had swept the area for bombs, finding 18 on the one-metre-wide
track. We crossed a wooden bridge and swam near a waterfall. I also took a dip
in a sheltered blue lagoon on the far riverbank.  
Crossing the bamboo bridge some time later, I was amazed by a sudden change in
the colour and speed of the river. An hour of leisure ended in excitement with
a raging, red torrent. Luckily everyone was out of the water.

_Photos: Cuc Phuong Resort & Spa_

**Vietnam Heritage, November-December Advertorial 2011 —** I pulled my luggage
on a tree-lined gravel path, passing buffaloes placidly grazing on harvested
paddy fields, farmers tending vegetable gardens and lotus ponds blooming pink
petals in mountain shades. Millions of golden pinto peanut flowers quivered
from the jade-green carpet.  
That was the beginnging of my wonderful vacation at the retreat of Cuc Phuong
Resort, in Nho Quan District, Ninh Binh Province, near Hanoi. Newly built and
just a walk away from Cuc Phuong National Park, the resort is an ideal choice
of relaxation for those who love nature and tranquillity.  
My lodging for the vacation was a bungalow gracefully hidden behind flowering
bushes, peacefully among golden flowers. The back looked on to a pinto peanut
[a forage plant] garden, over which rose mallows flowered like lanterns.  
The materials the buildings were made of added to the feeling of rurality in a
forested retreat. From the thatch roof to the folk Dong Ho painting on the
wall, from the wooden wardrobe to the bamboo lampshades, all brought me closer
to nature.  
I soaked myself in warm mineral water in a delicate in-house wooden tub. The
soothing sound of running water, the heat from the earth re-energized me after
the two-hour car ride from Hanoi. Cuc Phuong resort has an ample mineral-water
source 100 metres underground, used for bathing, therapy and recreation.  
To enhance the relaxing experience, Cuc Phuong Resort & Spa provides mineral
mud tubs, an outdoor swimming pool and an indoor hot-mineral-water pool with
spray massage and two tennis courts in lush, romantic suroundings. The resort
also has bicycles, boats, ping pong and billiards.  
At Cuc Phuong Resort & Spa I experienced one of the most tranquil nights of my
life. The only sounds I heard were the mountain breeze rustling the leaves of
the trees, the songs of insects and the gurgles of the stream flowing through
the boulders. No human noise.  
When I opened my door the next morning, the sun sent in thousands of aureate
rays, together with the pure warmth of the universe like a good wish for the
day. The wind was playing like a bamboo wind chime on the lawn, producing
joyful sounds. The mist had lifted off the ever-blooming pinto peanuts, and
was now hanging over the nearby mountains.  
At the centre of this ecological resort, my bungalow looked out on rock made a
world of art, geology, and nature. Travelling through volcanoes, sediment or
silt deposits, earthquakes and mudslides for millions of years, the igneous
rocks, the sedimentary rocks and the fossilized wood gave a sense of natural
familiarity.  
From the 200-seat Dabiru restaurant, the view included a three-hole golf
course, wave-shaped sand dunes, a rivulet, tropical flora growing all over,
the misty limestone mountain ranges of the Cuc Phuong primeval forest and the
185-hectare Thuong Sung lake.  
Serving Western and Vietnamese food, Cuc Phuong Resort & Spa includes Ninh
Binh specialties. Mountain goat and meat of free-range pigs and chickens
enhanced with a variety of forest vegetables and herbs make the natural and
organic dishes even more eye-catching and mouthwatering.  
At the Orchids Bar, next to a lake, I watched water lilies open their first
purple petals, next to the Prehistoric Stone Garden which I have already
mentioned.  
From the reception hall, a receptionist walked over. The lap of her reddish ao
dai flapped, mirroring itself in the water. Her high-heel shoes struck
rhythmically on the sinuous brick path. In the absolute tranquillity of the
green retreat, I found the clicking cheering and inspiring.n

11/20/2019,Princess of the Wild Coast,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/princess-of-the-wild-coast/,,By Pip de Rouvray ,,,"**Vietnam Heritage, October-November 2011 Advertorial —** I named it the Wild
Coast then. Wild it was too, that stretch of the coast south of Phan Thiet
town that curves its way down to Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province. There were only two
boutique hotels in those days at a place under the towering dunes called Doi
Su, in contrast to the already famous shoreline known as Mui Ne to the north.  
Around seven years ago I stayed at one of these hostelries and cycled the
seven kilometres or so down a deserted country lane. To my left was maquis-
type vegetation with wild flowers blooming and empty beaches pounded by the
waves of the East Sea. To my right was the ridge of the dunes with natural and
cultivated vegetation creeping up to it.  
My idle aim on that idyllic afternoon was to see the old French lighthouse at
Ke Ga. I reached the rocky headland that looks out to the lighthouse perched
on its islet. I recall seeing a hoarding that announced that a site had been
acquired on which a luxury hotel was to be built. My thoughts at the time were
that I had been lucky to know this beautiful wilderness before it had been
ruined in the name of mass tourism, just as the Costa Brava in Spain had been,
with its high-rise overdevelopment and environmental recklessness. Costa Brava
in Spanish, by the way, means wild coast.  
Fate has many twists and turns, and one of them came in the form of an
invitation to sample the delights of that baby whose imminent birth had been
advertised on the hoarding and who was now a bouncing three-year-old. Feeling
as if were in a fairy tale one morning, a limousine with the words Princess
Dâ€™Annam Resort and Spa emblazoned in gold on its side arrived at our door
step to whisk my wife, our 12-year-old daughter and myself away.  
It is a somewhat tiring four and one-half-hour drive, and for the first two
hours or so, you pass through the endless industrial eyesores of the suburbs
of HCM City and Bien Hoa city. The scenery does not rise beyond that of the
back of a long-distance bus or haulage truck. It is only when you approach
Binh Thuan Province itself that you are treated to green fields and low
mountains. However, by the time you eventually visit, the situation may have
eased, as a new highway cutting the journey time by half is slated to open in
2014. However, what lies at the end of the trip makes any slight discomfort
well worth enduring.  
Around 20 kilometres from the city of Phan Thiet, we turned off on a country
lane, down which we drove for 15 minutes with fields of dragonfruit and
undulating sandy hills in view to reach the shore. I was back in Wild Coast
country. The last time I went down this road was in the back of a pick-up
truck. Long stretches of it had yet to be metalled and covered in dust and red
sand, and we were well in need of a shower when we got to the hotel.  
The road now followed the shore I had once cycled along. There were changes
here too, as at regular intervals red-brick and tiled hotels had sprung up.
They looked like private villas transposed from southern Iberia. We sped past
them with their romantic names, Apricot Resort, Peaceful Hotel, Eco Spa resort
and Rockwater Bay Resort, before turning off onto a brand-new road flanked by
paddy fields with egrets stalking in them and reaching the jewel in the crown,
The Princess Dâ€™Annam.  
At first sight the hotel seems to be designed from back to front, but that is
for the good reason of protecting privacy. The arrival and departure area is
where the road ends. The beachfront part of the resort has no road access,
with the result that you may enjoy it without motorbikes whizzing by on the
sands and honking at bathers to get out of the way, which has been my
experience on similar beaches in Vietnam.  
We were met and greeted by senior management and given a very original and
refreshing welcome drink of chilled red karkady (a hibiscus-based beverage).
The actual registration took place at a wide writing desk in our Princess
Villa, to which we were graciously escorted.  
The villa proved to be luxury down to the last detail. The writing desk was an
imposing piece of furniture, and this, with a four-poster bed and a huge
widescreen LCD television, were the features of the main living area. From
here we stepped out to our secluded pool area with high walls all around. The
pool itself was big enough to fit all the family, and when not actually
soaking, there was a long divan on which to stretch out on and enjoy the
plants and flowers. At the back was an open-air bathroom with a large tub and
showering area. There was a huge cake of scented soap by the basin and all the
toiletries imaginable. Even the beautiful wooden comb was an original.  
We rested a while and then set out to explore and enjoy the grounds. Although
it is only three years old, this hotel exudes old-world colonial charm. With
its series of pools and jungle-type landscaping leading up to a colonnaded
passageway, with the ocean shining like infinity at its end, it put me in mind
of Angkor Wat.  
One amazing feature is the Ginger Garden set up with the co-operation of the
Singapore Botanical Gardens. It has 220 of the more than 1,300 species of the
ginger family. Just listening to the names of some them displayed on aluminium
plates and assembled from tropical Africa, South America and from around South
East Asia should show what a wonderful place The Princess is to relax: Red-Hot
Catâ€™s Trail, Song of India, Firecracker plant, Coral Plant, Torch Ginger,
Angel Wing, Rain of Gold, Peacock plant and Pinewheel Ginger, to name but a
few.  
I sat down to afternoon coffee and a chat with M. Jean-Philippe Beghin, the
general manager at the Terrace Restaurant, which overlooks the beach and the
resort’s largest swimming pool. I remarked on how beautiful the beach was,
especially with the view of the lighthouse on its rocky islet.  
â€˜Yesâ€™ he says, â€˜it is a shallow beach which means less wind.â€™ Although
as he speaks, we are entertained by the para-gliders getting lifted above the
waves. â€˜If there is a problem here, it is too much sand. Every year or so,
it builds up so much we have to bulldoze some away.â€  
Jean Philippe explains that although the resort is ideally placed next to an
authentic fishing village and there is the opportunity to hire a bicycle or
motorbike to explore the Vietnamese countryside on its doorstep, many guests
are content to simply rest up in the resort and on the sands. The Princess, I
learn, is at pains to be environmentally friendly with its B sewage treatment
system that enables water to be recycled for the gardens. It also is concerned
to be of benefit to the local community and recruits 50 per cent of its staff
from the nearby village. They also actively make presentations to local school
leavers.  
Jean Philippe notices some interesting trends. A while ago the guests were
mainly from abroad. Now, as the hotel begins to sell by its own bush, they
have 40 per cent occupancy from locals and foreign residents in the country.
â€˜We expect the ratio to be 50 next year,â€™ he says. â€˜Another interesting
thing is that we are beginning to receive guests from abroad coming for a nine
or 10-day beach holiday, as people do in Thailand or Malaysia.â€™  
The Spa occupies a two-storey building to the side of the beachfront
restaurant and concierge. There are separate sections for men and women, and
it has all the facilities you can imagine. At ground level are the steambath
and sauna, while upstairs are the rooms for a soothing body massage, with
views of the lighthouse and the forest to ease the soul. We noticed flagons of
olive-oil coloured lotions set by the tables and a large bathtub for water
treatments.  
Not only will your muscles and spirit be rejuvenated by the Princess, but with
high-class gastonomy, she also caters for your stomach. We had a light lunch.
My daughter and I feasted on two pizzas: one a hot and fiery Diavola and the
other a Margherita with the colours of the Italian flag—cheese for white,
tomato for green, and fresh basil for green. My wife had a traditional
Vietnamese Mi Xao Hai San (stir-fried seafood noodles).  
Maiâ€™s eyebrows were raised by the bill, which came to over VND800,000
($38.10). It was National Day, so most of the guests were Vietnamese, and she
overheard others mumbling about the prices. In fairness we would have to say
that these prices would actually seem cheap for someone coming here from
England, given the luxury surroundings in which the meals are served. The main
point is: the food is good.  
For dinner I found a surprise Lebanese mezze. My daughter and I enjoyed the
hummus, tahina, mattabal and tabbouleh exotica served with pitta bread. For me
it brought back memories of the Middle East and would have gone down well with
half a bottle of arrack, but a glass of Two Oceans white wine from South
Africa did the trick just as well. Mai enjoyed the fish in clay pot (Ca Kho
To) with white rice and vegetables.  
I need not have worried that first day I discovered Ke Ga all those years ago.
The appearance of a luxury resort hotel here has enhanced the splendour of the
wild coast. Congratulations to both the provincial Binh Thuan government and
the doughty foreign investors who have brought the Princess here. I was just
being selfish. Now many more people can come enjoy this still unspoiled area
and recharge their batteries. Of course, you can find accommodation here to
suit all budgets, but if you can afford to pay a little more, the Princess is
the perfect place for a totally uplifting physical and spiritual makeover. She
provides a perfect antidote to the rigours of modern living.n

**Vietnam Heritage, October-November 2011 Advertorial —** In the golden
sunlight among the blazing pitaya farms, and some dozen metres off the sinuous
main coconut tree-lined road in the resort capital of Mui Ne in south-central
Binh Thuan Province—just minutes away from historic sites and the cityâ€™s
splendors—there is a masterpiece that juxtaposes architecture and nature, the
Sea Links Beach Hotel.  
Bringing the highlands sense to the sea-line coast, the five-star hotel offers
an unforgettable experience to relax and unwind.  
It is astonishment at first sight. Looked at from afar, the building,
constructed in the shape of a terraced field, emerges like a unique and chic
gem sparkling between the azure sky and the green earth surface.  
Perched atop a sand hill, the hotel with its magnificence and grandeur never
fails to take even the most demanding guestâ€™s breath away. Every one of the
modernly equipped, spacious, elegant 188 rooms, from the Superior to the
President Suite, offers guests a panoramic view of the ivory sandy crescent of
the peaceful bay of Mui Ne and the 18-hole Sea Links Golf Course, together
with the recreation paradise Sea Links Beach Villa, another project in the Sea
Links Golf-Hotel-Villa complex.  
In addition to a private, exclusive beach, Sea Links Beach Hotel has four
palatial landscaped swimming pools that are the envy of many other high-end
hotels in Vietnam.  
â€˜You can relax and find things for everyone in the family to do,â€™ said
Michelle Singson, the sales and marketing director. â€˜We cater to families.
While the father is enjoying his game on our world-class golf course or
sweating it out at our well-equipped fitness center, the mother can choose
from an array of first-rate treatment in our Spa center, and the children can
play at the Kidâ€™s Club, playground or swimming pools.â€™  
It is home away from home. Here one feels the homeyness from the very first
moment, at the lobby, in the genuine smiles on the multilingual receptionists,
in the sweetness and warmth of the complimentary welcome drink, and in the
eagerness of the porter to help not only with the luggage, but also in the
functioning of five-star amenities in the room. â€˜Donâ€™t forget to turn the
bedside switch control to the sleep mode before you go to bed. Any motion will
turn the lights on unexpectedly,â€™ he reminds guests about the automated
electronics system.  
Where tropical chic meets traditional elegance, Sea Links Beach Hotel enables
guests to enjoy modern luxurious facilities amid the wonder of nature. When
the back door to the private balcony opens, a strong gust of sea-scented air
rushes in, wrapping everything in its invisible but refreshing arms. Two bay
laurels are blossoming, hiding the tiny snow-white petals in the shining
bushes.  
In the tranquility of the maritime night, in the absence of pollution, in the
nonexistence of chaos and disorder, the fragrance dominates, scenting the pot
of tea on the small table between the two S-shaped rattan deck-chairs.  
Just a few metres away, beyond the infinity swimming pools, off the coconut
garden, from the East Sea, ocean waves dance the eternal dance of freedom; the
wind sings the ever-lasting song of joy as if to lull the sleeping guests and
keep company for those still awake.  
Nature finds guests wherever they go in this place. Sea Green Restaurant
offers all-day dining with the best of East and West, either in the majestic
dining hall or in the open air of the terrace with a spectacular view of the
ocean and mountains around.  
â€˜Even foreign guests say they didnâ€™t expect something so impressive in
Vietnam,â€™ Ms Singson told Vietnam Heritage magazine.  
â€˜Our first impressions as we drove in were very positive as the setting is
really beautiful. The lobby is vast and has an enormous fish tank that is very
cool. Solid windows in the lobby really showcase the gorgeous sea and setting.
The staff was very friendly and eager to help. This hotel has fantastic views
of the water,â€™ wrote guest Couchczar, the moniker used by a tourist from
Beijing who described her familyâ€™s vist to the hotel on the global travel
website www.tripadvisor.co.uk.

11/20/2019,The glamorous safety hammer,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/the-glamorous-safety-hammer/,,Text and picture by Cookie Vu,,,"**Vietnam Heritage, September-October 2011 Advertorial–** About 500 cruises of
all kinds are always waiting to take you around, touring the UNESCO World  
_Heritage site Ha _Long Bay, in northeastern Vietnam. How to compare, to
choose? In my case the boat chose me, as someone who could write an
advertorial for them, an advertisement that looks like editorial.  
â€˜The bay is only one, the scene is the same,â€™ Mr Nguyen Ngoc Quang said.
â€˜The vessels canâ€™t be more modern.â€™ Than his, that is. Mr Quang is the
manager of the â€˜five-starâ€™ Syrena (Syrena, according to Polish mythology,
is a draconian snake goddess, also partly woman and fish, who protects the
river WisÅ‚a and the Polish capital city, Warsaw). Mr Quang and the crew aim
to excel, in any case, in â€˜soft servicesâ€™, a term more useful than it
sounds, in the case of this boat.  
But first of all, the cozy reception, with smiling staff waiting on board to
hand you a glass of warm drink and steaming handkerchief.  
The ship, with her dazzlingly bright red sails like a pair of sirens dancing
over the descending dragon of Ha Long [háº¡ means â€˜descendâ€™, long dragon]
Bay, has 17 well-appointed, deluxe cabins and suites on the lower and main
decks. Handcrafted furniture and delicate upholstery add warmth and light to
the comfort from amenities like queen-size beds, air-conditioners and en-suite
bathrooms with powerful hot-and-cold showers. The picture windows provide
light and spectacular views of the almost 2,000 karst isles of various sizes
and shapes.  
At the Lotus Restaurant, on the upper deck, the menu has choices Vietnamese to
international, prepared by four-star Ha Long Plaza Hotelâ€™s culinary chief
with first-class ingredients on first-class equipment. You also get to enjoy
your meals on the breezy balconies where rattan chairs and tables are always
available.  
On the sundeck, the Sunset Bar offers unparalleled enjoyment when you, bikini
clad, drink in hand, watch the vermilion sun receding behind the mountains
before it completely disappears into the sea. Or when the night is falling,
you, stretching on the rattan deckchair without a care in the world, stare
into the starry nights or bask in the stream of silvery moonlight. The next
morning, after the sea breeze wakes you up, the Syrenaâ€™s staff will
introduce you to Tai Chi, on this very sundeck.  
The most outstanding â€˜soft advantageâ€™ of the Syrena is, as the manager,
Nguyen Ngoc Quang, told Vietnam Heritage, the safety equipment. The safety
system, after a couple of tragic shipwrecks in Ha Long Bay earlier this year,
has become extraordinarily important. Here on Syrena Cruise, the matter is not
in question.  
Each cabin is equipped with sufficient life jackets. A torch, a hammer, a
fire-extinguisher hang in the most visible corner of the cabin [and are hard,
in fact, just the way we like them]. An â€˜automatic generation dynamo
emergency flashlightâ€™ ensures the whole room light if the central generator
stops functioning.  
Safety charts are available in Vietnamese, Chinese and English. You canâ€™t
miss them because they are right on the door in your room.  
GPS, VHF, radars, walkie-talkies, water-leakage alarms, smoke-detectors, heat-
detectors are all in compliance with the local regulations. Two self-inflating
floats, together able to support 50 passengers, are also provided â€“ going
further than official requirements.  
A document issued by Quang Ninh Fire Department certified all 26 personnel on
the Syrena had done a fire-fighting course.  
The Syrena crew take turns at watch, so you can feel safe heading for bed on
that floating palace in the hissing sound of the waves and the eternal
whispers of the oceanic breeze.  
Close your eyes and dream of a world where boundaries donâ€™t exist.n

**Vietnam Heritage, September-October 2011 —** One weekend, singer Pham Anh
Khoa invited his friends to go to BÃ£i HÃµm, Ba Ngoi, Cam Ranh City, Khanh Hoa
Province, in southern central Vietnam. BÃ£i HÃµm is a five-hectare valley
between two rocky hills 50 to 100 metres high, overlooking the sea. There was
no road to the valley, so we had to take a boat for 20 minutes.  
When we arrived, we put the tent, a canvas, pots and pans and food and drinks
in a spot by the sea and set up camp. While some were getting up the tent and
hammocks up, others were looking for dry sticks to use as firewood and fishing
for squids or diving in the sea for fish.  
A local man called Bay caught a batoid fish of about five kilograms, a
mangrove red snapper, a leatherjacket and an eel. Anh Khoaâ€™s friends caught
some squid, sea urchins and some areola babylon snails.  
That was enough food for the evening, so everyone went swimming in the sea or
played football on the fine, white sand, in what is considered the islandâ€™s
most beautiful place. The waves were not big, because of Binh Ba Island in
front of the valley; and the water was clear enough for us to see the fish in
the water.  
Singers Thuy Trang and Thanh Thao left their kids in the care of somebody
else, put on goggles and dived in an area of about two metresâ€™ depth, just
to see colourful marine creatures, like sea anemones, corals, sea cucumbers
and starfish. After that, the group got on a boat to explore a coral reef at
BÃ£i Ráº¡ng nearby.

11/20/2019,Campfire and frost on a Central Highlands walk,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/campfire-and-frost-on-a-central-highlands-walk/,,By Nguyen Dang Khoa,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/6.jpg,"![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/6.jpg)

**Vietnam Heritage, August-September 2011 —** At 9 a.m., we started from the
forestry station Klong Klanh on National Road 723, 50 km north of Dalat. The
_towering peak Bidoup, covered with dark cloud, seemed to appear just in front
of us, but the tour guide said, â€˜It looks pretty close, but it will take us
the whole day to reach it.â€™  
We had walked 500 m along a track in pleasantly fresh forest, when Mr Son, a
technical officer of the Bidoup-NÃºi BÃ National Park, said that in the area,
earlier this year, Dr Jodi Rowley, from Australia, had discovered a frog that
could fly from branch to branch aided by its webbed feet. When this frog is a
tadpole it has long, pointed canine teeth, so it has been nicknamed â€˜the
flying vampire frogâ€™. Dr Rowleyâ€™s was the first discovery of a frog with
these characteristics.  
At 10.30 a.m., in green tropical forest 1,930 m above sea level, one of our
group glimpsed a group of monkeys. They ran fast into dense cover, to
everyoneâ€™s regret.  
In forest with pines hundreds of years old, the leader, Mr Truong Hoang
Phuong, M.Sc. in geography, specialist in topography and geomorphology, said
the Bidoup-NÃºi BÃ forest had a kind of pine, with flat, double leaves, that
was rare and valuable, which used to be thought extinct, until, at the end of
the 19th century, a German botanist, M. Krempfii, had discovered it. In 1921,
a French scientist, H. Lecomte, confirmed the species was not just
prehistoric. In the 1940s, two American scientists, Litenle and Krisphind,
decided the tree was a kind of Ducanpopinus which existed at the time of the
dinosaurs.  
At 13.15, we ate lunch in an even, flat place near a brook. After lunch, we
had walked a short distance when we came across several clusters of orchids
hanging on trees. A forest ranger said that in the Bidoup National Park there
were nearly 300 species of orchids, 200 to be found in the area where we were.
Humans stole them to sell. Forest officers found it hard to stop this.  
In the area, there are also many kinds of valuable timber trees, the most
valuable the pÆ¡mu, many of which are 40-50 metres high, their girth equal to
a circle of six or seven men holding hands; one has a girth equal to a circle
of nine men and is over 1,300 years old.  
The peak of Mount Bidoup 2 had a lot of â€˜Ä‘á»— quyÃªn,â€™ Rhododendron, with
flowers blooming, which, from a little distance, made the whole area purple.
Mount Bidoup 2 has the nickname â€˜the Do Quyen Peakâ€™.  
About 300 m from the top, we had to climb slowly, on a steep slope. Though it
was cold, I sweated. At 4.40 p.m., we arrived. Cloud and mist on the skin made
me cold.  
Mr Phuong said Bidoup was 2,287 m in altitude and had the coordinates
N1205472-E10839732. We had come 7.8 km from our starting-point. The peak was
the highest of the three high peaks of the Langbiang highland. We could not
see the scenery, because of the dense foliage. On the way through Bidoup-NÃºi
BÃ , in this thickly wooded area, visibility was extremely limited.  
Mr Vo Duan, a technical specialist from Bidoup-NÃºi BÃ National Park, said the
Bidoup peak and the adjacent areas constituted one of 221 endemic-bird centres
of the world. Not only were there many resident species but there were also
dozens of endemic ones. The latter were on the International Union for
Conservation of Nature red list.  
It got completely dark. The night screen of the  
forest together with the dense mist that formed below the foliage made the
space thicken. Flashlights were on. The temperature was about 10Â°C. I
didnâ€™t feel cold when I walked, but as soon as I stopped for a moment I felt
very cold.  
At 7.30, we stopped and ate dinner beside a blazing fire. After dinner we felt
dead tired and cold. Everybody glided headlong into the tent or coiled himself
in a hammock.  
At 6 a.m., the forest was covered with frost. Several people huddled up to the
fire while breakfast was prepared. It seemed nobody had slept, because of the
cold. We were in February, 2011.  
On the first day, we had climbed. On the second we went up and down, through
green, subtropical forest. At 10.30 a.m., the group came to an area called
LiÃªn Ca ÄÃ¡, 2,004 m above sea level, where we found a lot of footprints of
deer and boar. In this area there were also gaurs and langurs, according to Mr
Duan.  
At noon we ate lunch near the border of the Bidoup-NÃºi BÃ and PhÆ°á»›c BÃ¬nh
National Parks, 1,762 m above sea level, and kept on along the border. Toward
dusk we pitched camp near the Äáº¡ Äen brook.  
One of the largest national parks in Vietnam, Bidoup-NÃºi BÃ is the source of
several rivers that flow across the Central Highlands, Central Vietnam and
south-eastern Vietnam. This forest is also the place the culture of several
ethnic groups is preserved. It is an ideal spot for scientific research and
the preservation of a diverse ecology.  
I wondered why there were tracks in the tall forest. Mr Binh To Ha Lung, of
the Chu ethnic group, said his grandfather had told him that in the old days
people had used horses to carry rice and salt from Ninh Thuan, on the coast,
to Lam Dong, to exchange for products of the forest. In wartime, people from
Ninh Thuan had used the track to carry rice and salt for the military. Mr
Nguyen Xuan Vinh, from the Institute of Tropical Ecology, said that from time
to time ethnic-minority people still used it.  
On the third day, visibility was better. Ranges of hills and mountains wore
old pine trees, trees alternating with plots that looked like gigantic green
carpets on the slopes of mountains or in valleys.  
We were trekking up hill and down. Several stretches were on sharp ridges.  
At 3 p.m., we came across a rock as big as four-seater car, which did not look
like anything special, but the guide said it was a genie, very spiritually
alive. People living in the PhÆ°á»›c BÃ¬nh forest used to go here to pray. He
then suggested we all say prayers, pick a flower or a twig, put it on the rock
and make wishes.  
After we had said prayers, we walked down an abrupt mountain slope which was
also particularly long, about 2 km. At the end of the slope was the confluence
of two streams, the Äáº¡ MÃ¢y and Äáº¡ Äen, with a wide and very flat area,
where we decided to pitch camp.  
At 6.30 a.m. on the fourth day we came to a stretch with rocks all over it,
about 100 m long,  
5 m wide and 7 m deep, which looked like a tunnel without a roof.  
Mr Phuong, the geomorphology specialist, said the Äáº¡ MÃ¢y brook had eroded
the half-tunnel during thousands of years. Mr Tuan came up with the
coordinates N1205916-E10844840, and altitude, 541 m.  
After more than an hour exploring the area, we came back to take a rest, ate
lunch, then kept crossing and recrossing the brook, through bamboo forest. We
walked a few kilometres, when we saw the first house, a little bit further,
and a village with 10 rudimentarily houses on stilts on the slope. Nearby a
few women were heading rice with their hands and putting the harvest into
bamboo baskets they carried on their backs.  
At 3.30 p.m., we came to a village of the Bo Lang ethnic group and rented
motorbikes for 10 km to the Báº¡c RÃ¢y 2 hamlet. We crossed a suspension
bridge over a 100 m wide river, then saw a black gaur, huge in comparison with
50 cows and oxen grazing nearby.  
Mr Chung, an employee of the management board of the PhÆ°á»›c BÃ¬nh National
Park, said, â€˜ . . . No bull dares stand within 10 m of him. He is like a
king among pretty imperial maids.â€™ This gaur, weighing nearly 1,000 kg, had
been there less than a year. Early on, it had butted and killed an ox.
Sometimes it had swum the river looking for cows.n  
NOTES:  
The Bidoup-NÃºi BÃ National Park covers 64,800 square hectares in the province
of Lam Dong. It is mostly high hills and mountains and has a subtropical
climate. There are 1,561 botanical species, 74 of them rare and valuable and
recorded in the Vietnam red book and 258 animal species, 14 in the Vietnam red
book and 17 listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature red
list. The PhÆ°á»›c BÃ¬nh National Park, in Ninh Thuan Province, southern
Central Vietnam, covers 19,814 ha, is 1,500 m-1,800 m above sea level and
reaches from hot, dry zone to subtropical. Big differences in temperature and
rainfall mean as many as 14 types of forests. The botanical system consists of
1,225 species, 75 of them valuable and liable to extinction. The animal system
consists of 327 species, 50 in the Vietnam red book and 29 on International
Union for Conservation of Nature list.  
The trip was undertaken in February, 2011, and organised by the management
boards of the two national parks Bidoup-Nui BÃ and PhÆ°á»›c BÃ¬nh for
scientific and tourism purposes.  
Participants included representatives of the travel company Vietmark,
scientists and journalists. Mr Phuong from the Vietmark travel company invited
the author to join the group.  
The gaur is the same one as was confronted and described in some detail by
Dang Khoa in the May-June edition of Vietnam Heritage.

11/20/2019,Heavenly Hoi An riverside weekend,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/heavenly-hoi-an-riverside-weekend/,,Text and picture by Annie Eagle,,,"**Vietnam Heritage, July-August 2011 Advertorial–** I had the great privilege
of an invited stay at Hoi An Riverside Resort one recent weekend. Arriving
after six on Saturday evening, somewhat stressed from lack of sleep in Danang
from the cacophony of house construction next door, this was just the break I
needed â€“ an oasis of calm, where the only sounds were wind in the trees and
the songs of crickets and frogs.  
While a porter in a fabulous black hat took care of my motorbike, I was warmly
welcomed at reception. The very charming Chu, looking much younger than his 28
years, escorted me to the bar for a â€˜welcome drinkâ€™ of fresh-pressed apple
and orange juice at a table overlooking the river. Gazing across to the rice
paddies, where farmers tilled the land till the sun went down, I unwound from
my week. While sipping on an â€˜Italian mojitoâ€™, deliciously laced with
Campari, beautifully decorated with those regrettable plastic straws, I
watched flickering flower lanterns drift downriver (a nightly event that one
local refers to as the â€˜evening pollutionâ€™). I couldâ€™ve done without the
tinny bar music. After dark, a shrimper, visible only by his headtorch, poled
his way silently through the water.  
The attentive young waiter, Binh, to my surprise, was 29, married and father
of a one-year old. Heâ€™d worked at the resort for seven years. Vinh, 46, the
porter who escorted me to my room had worked there eleven years, since the
establishment of the resort, the first in Hoi An. Riverside is Vietnamese-run
and changed owners last year.  
My room was Japanese-style with a garden view from a private balcony. Tatami
mats underfoot, I was mellowed by the subtle beige hues of walls papered with
hand-made rice paper of a simple three-leaf motif. Furniture was low-slung in
dark brown wood. I was to especially savour using the writing desk. An
abundance of windows invited in the breeze. Everything had been tastefully and
thoughtfully prepared. A single purple daisy between two serrated leaves lay
on each bed and peeked from between neatly folded towels. It felt almost
sacrilegious to disturb them.  
Almost everything was made of natural materials and a special effort had been
made to individually present the collection of bathroom toiletries in small
brown packets. Two small rounds of soap were as inviting as a chocolate
fondants.  
I slept well and woke late to the sounds of children playing and birdsong. The
wind rustled through mature stands of bamboo, coconut, areca and fan palms,
banana, frangipani and Norfolk Island Pine, which afford welcome shade.
Riverside is a haven for wild birds (a delight to see them flitting between
the trees) and huge black butterflies. Formerly there was a â€˜botanical
gardenâ€™, I was told. Stone pathways meander between the villas and one
encounters the occasional Cham statue or urn or water feature. I am an ocean
swimmer, but I did enjoy the pool and some long moments in a hammock beneath
coconut fronds.  
I dined overlooking the river on a 4-course meal: a salad of mustard greens,
rocket and succulent river shrimp with a vinaigrette a little heavy on the
vinegar; tomato cream soup was like velvet, a perfect balance between sweet
and sour; basa fish steamed in banana leaves was exquisitely presented, but
too salty for my taste; the fish in a clay pot on Sunday evening was also too
intensely flavoured; dessert was luxurious dark chocolate drizzled over a
halved banana or cut tropical fruits. I was the only diner (both evenings).  
Buffet breakfast offered a vast choice of Western food. I ate the same
delicious selection both mornings: rolls and Emmentaler cheese, croissants and
homemade tropical fruit jams, a pancake and yogurt. The small pack of butter
was molten into a strange texture, which reminded me that here was another
little piece of plastic pollution that could be eliminated. On Monday, the
only table available was close to the bar and I was not enamoured of the
digital â€˜Country Roseâ€™ and â€˜Morning has Brokenâ€™, playing rather too
loudly. The orchestra of natural sounds was enough.  
On my way to Sense Spa for an oriental massage, I passed lotus ponds and paths
lined with torch ginger. The massage was excellent, except a little too firm
and fast, and ended exquisitely with the therapist wiping off the oil with hot
wet towels. I paid $40 (about what I used to charge in the UK as a Shiatsu
therapist).  
One more dip in the pool was the perfect end to a heavenly weekend.

_  
 **Vietnam Heritage, June-July 2011 —** In May, I stayed at the newly opened
An Lam Ninh Van Bay Villas, 16 km north of Nha Trang, on the Central Coast,
with a group of reporters invited by Epikurean, the villasâ€™ management
company.  
To get there I took a train from Ho Chi Minh City at 11 p.m. and arrived in
Nha Trang at 5.30 a.m. Then I continued by car; high-rise buildings mushroomed
on the left, sea lay deep blue on the right and mountain ranges stood in the
distance.  
The simple wooden board of an An Lam Ninh Van Bay Villas sign was modest
beside the road and I wondered how big and luxurious the resort could be. The
reception house at the sign was of wood and simple, though spacious. From
there a speedboat was to be operated by a young man, who confirmed, â€˜Yes we
have life jacket, if you need one.â€™ He seemed to be very confident about his
boat. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the resort. The calm of the sea at
An Lam Ninh Van Bay Villas made me decide I would swim out to its pontoon, in
fact might put in several kilometres.  
To welcome me was a young man who introduced himself in Vietnamese: â€˜Good
morning, I am Phong, I am your butler. Do you want to have breakfast now or do
you want to go to your villa?â€™ I chose villa first, and he drove me in a
six-wheeler. On the left mountain, on the right trees. A small area of new
plants in beds followed a wooden wall. The setting reminded me of Vietnamâ€™s
northern villages, the height of the wall suggesting privacy.  
My villa was number 6. I heard piano music on walking through the gate. A
garden and then another space, opening toward a lake and, further, the sea.  
â€˜Happy birthday â€˜Chá»‹ Háº£iâ€™ was the wish Mr Phong the butler messaged
to me after he showed me the inside of my brief home. I was surprised and
happy. Yet I felt a bit lonely in this big, thatched wooden house. The music
was exactly what I like, romantic melodies. The villa was open in all
directions, with a breeze swinging white curtains and moving flowering plants
in the garden. The swing chair in the living room seemed too big for one. The
bath tub and the shower in the open air were surrounded with high, flowering
plants, booming nature. Complete privacy. On the terrace, the plunge pool was
inviting and I turned fish.  
I regretted being alone. I wished I had someone beside me. And on this special
day it must be better to have your closest person with you.  
The inspection, formal work, passed quickly; our group took lots of photos of
the sea, the rocks, different types of villas, the wine cellar and library
(they were being completed). The thing I got inspired by most was a big area
by the road where yellow flowers grew as if wild. No other flowers could have
been more charming. It is the beauty, at An Lam Villas.  
In the afternoon, I went to the beach. The sand was clean, the sea blue, calm,
no waves. But after only a few metres from the white-sand, smooth beach, my
feet caught stones and mud. I chose to swim along the beach instead of heading
further into the sea. It struck me that a calm surface might hide a lot
underneath. I discovered later that a river from the mountain reached the sea
here, and the protective mountains around made the area particularly still.
Hence, perhaps, mud in the basement of the water.  
A friend in the group turned to the communal swimming pool next to the sea. It
was not athletic-size but good enough for low-risk-takers.  
Around sunset we cruised the bay for an hour. I met the chief engineer of the
villas, who introduced himself â€˜I am called â€œB.â€ by my family.â€™ So I
called him Mr B. He confirmed that no waste water from the villas went into
the sea. The general manager of the resort, Mr Frederick Maclean, later told
Vietnam Heritage each villa had its own septic tank, which would be emptied
periodically to tanker, and the resort was thinking about intercepting the
grey water (as distinct from toilet sewage) and processing it for use on the
gardens. It was really good news to me, as I love swimming in the sea. Mr B.
was enthusiastic about other projects that the owners of An Lam Villas were
going to develop in the area, following an eco-green concept.  
Mr Frederick hosted a dinner for our group on the beach. It was especially
remarkable, as it was the middle of the lunar month, when the moon is full and
bright. Various kinds of fish, squids, crabs, shrimps and oysters were
grilled. Fresh and delicious. We then sang in different languages. I got
wishes from new friends and a birthday cake from Ms Victoria Maclean, Mr
Frederickâ€™s wife and the villasâ€™ manager in charge of service standards. I
was very happy, and at the same time felt in debt to those who had taken so
much care. I only suggest that the villas should go further and have a guitar
ready and tuned, to go with this purity of nature, on which guests might love
to express themselves.  
Back from the dinner, I found the bedroom done, with air-conditioner on and
mosquito net hung exactly. On the terrace of the villa, the moon was even
brighter. I turned off the air-conditioner and opened the door, to let the
moonlight and breeze in. It was full tranquillity, with the sound of â€˜ve
sáº§uâ€™ (cicadas) sometimes arising from somewhere back in the direction of
the mountain. The soft sound of piano again in the house â€“ so peaceful and
relaxing.  
We had to go back to the city the following day, after only one night. It was
a pity that I didnâ€™t have enough time to talk to the chef, Mr David Thai. I
would have asked for the recipe for the appetiser crispy shrimp and mango
salad and dessert tutti-frutti mousse with mango coulis.  
After accompanying us to the speedboat, Mr Frederick stood on the pier to
wave. He looked a giant on the island.  
The place is soon to add over 20 new villas to the current 14.  
I am sure that if you happen to go to An Lam Ninh Van Bay Villas on your
birthday or another special occasion Mr Frederick knows about, you will be in
for lots of pleasures and surprises.

CafÃ© Chanh in Hoi An  
Photo: Vu Trong Anh_

**Vietnam Heritage, June-July 2011 —** The owner of CafÃ© Tieu, a woman who
moved to Hoi An in 1954 and was recently living with her children and
grandchildren in a small house at the Hoi An market, showed me black-and-white
pictures of her in her shop in the 1960s, with customers from abroad â€˜who
took a picture because they fell in love with the face of the woman owner from
the Northâ€™.  
Eighty-eight-year-old Mr Dao, owner of CafÃ© Dao, founded in 1950, said he had
shut down his shop seven years ago. His daughter turned it into a souvenir
shop. He said, â€˜Business is very different now. Then I slept little and
served the customers from 3 a.m. till midnight.â€™ On New Year’s Eve he stayed
open till dawn and gave customers a New Yearâ€™s card. Each day he sold
hundreds of cups of coffee, but didnâ€™t need an assistant. He chose the beans
and roasted and ground them, with secrets he is still proud of.  
Old customers, especially artists, still remembered Mr Dao. He said, â€˜I
never go anywhere, but I know everything.â€™ These days, every morning Mr Dao
made his own coffee, drank it, got dressed neatly then walked around with a
felt hat on. He said, â€˜I need to enjoy my life to make up for the time I was
up to my ears in work.â€™ Mr Dao still kept a small, blue, steel plate with
the words â€˜CafÃ© Daoâ€™, painted in white, on it on the wall of his house.  
Of the three old coffee shops in Hoi An, the Dao, the Tieu and the Chanh, only
the CafÃ© Chanh, in front of the Assembly Hall of the Chinese Congregation (or
Le Nghia school) was still operating. It worked perfunctorily and had been
reduced to less than half its former area. Unless you were a regular, you
would not have recognized this as a coffee shop: no signboard, no music, no
â€˜designâ€™ no decoration, only five small wooden tables and a few stools not
far from a wooden bed.  
Mrs Chanh, the owner, over 60, was sitting with regulars. â€˜Long time no
see,â€™ she said to me. Younger than CafÃ© Dao or CafÃ© Tieu, CafÃ© Chanh came
into being in 1969. During the 1980s, when the national economy was centrally-
planned, with subsidies, Mrs Chanh could sell a thousand cups a day, though
just a few years ago her shop still had so many customers extra chairs and
tables had to be put on the veranda. Now she could sell only a few dozen cups.
The customers had mostly been frequenting the shop for dozens of years.  
Among the regulars was a man from Hanoi who had made his living in Hoi An
since the 1950s. His name was M. â€˜He comes here, refusing to go anywhere
else,â€™ Mrs Chanh said. Apparently he spoke out cheerfully to everybody but
really wanted to talk to the woman owner.  
Now there were so many coffee shops in Hoi An that you almost needed a
directory. A â€˜town of coffee shopsâ€™ had been built within a few years in
Nguyen Duy Hieu Street, with impressive designs, for example, Thien Duong, Ba
Lu, Da Cuoi and GoGo.  
Those who wanted to listen to music mixed with the babbling of a man-made
spring would go to this area.  
Young customers with boisterous lifestyles would have gone to the Tinh Thuong,
at the Le Loi Street intersection, where you could thump along to a song out
of a loudspeaker.  
The female customers have gathered at quiet shops such as Thien Thanh and
Tigon.  
Well-educated people and the artists would go to shops with a violet trellis
and classical music, in alleys, like Lac Vien, Serenade and Ha Vang.  
Those who wanted to listen to live music would have gone to the only coffee
shop that provided it, the Cung Tram Pho CafÃ©. The music was of the genre
known as â€˜pre-1975â€™.  
Coffee shops more reserved for foreigners were in Bach Dang Street and Cua Dai
Street, such as CafÃ© Can, CafÃ© Thang Long and CafÃ© Des Amis, where you not
only drank coffee but ate dumplings, váº¡c cake or cao láº§u soup, listened to
classical music or flamenco, looked at the Hoai River at dusk, wrote down
feelings in notebooks and sent e-mails.  
There was something in particular about the Des Amis coffee shop, owned by Mr
Nguyen Manh Kim, at 52 Bach Dang Street. Extraordinary power came not only
from the tasty coffee or the delicious food but from the ownerâ€™s being able
to speak different languages fluently, having fine remarks and being smart in
business.  
Des Amis was a not very big coffee shop where you could view the Hoai River.
For seventeen years, Mr Kim had been doing business in his own way: no menu,
no tablecloth, but the dish appeared miraculously quickly, at least according
to a comment written by customer called Helen. Customers who came back after
five or ten years could still find their original impressions in a book.  
Mr Kim said that in the early days nine foreign students had stopped their
bikes in front of his shop and said they were students and had been told about
the shop with its tasty coffee and delicious food but they could afford only
half-price. Mr Kim had said, â€˜No,â€™ which had made them sad, and had then
said that â€˜Noâ€™ meant there was no half price, which in turn meant they
could eat and drink free, which the students had done for two weeks. For the
last meal he had invited them to eat with his family. They had left their
testimonials, including something like, â€˜During our trip, if anyone we meet
is as goodhearted as Mr Kim, we wonâ€™t want to return home. We would want to
travel around the world forever …â€™  
Among the coffee shops whose owners wanted to make them more attractive with
impressive designs was the Thang Long CafÃ©, on the other side of An Hoi
Bridge, near the Japanese Covered Bridge. Many would have called this â€˜the
cafÃ© with candlesâ€™, because the owner had lit candles on stands he had
designed himself and the wax had flowed and built up.  
Many customers, lost in thought, watched the wax melting and running and then
thought about human life, of the passing of time, and reading G. Apollinaire,
for example. The shop was intended to serve foreign tourists only, but
Vietnamese customers were welcomed equally and even at more Vietnamese prices.

11/20/2019,Humans prey on the bee-eaters of Binh Thuan,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/humans-prey-on-the-bee-eaters-of-binh-thuan/,,Text and Photos By Le Hoai Phuong,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/a.jpg&&http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/b.jpg,"![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/a.jpg)

_Bee-eaters make their nests in an earth cliff._

**Vietnam Heritage, June-July 2011 —** More than ten years ago, in Binh Thuan
Province [on the southern Central Coast], I used to get a ride on a fishing
boat out to sea to take photographs. On returning, one day, I noticed a
peculiar, red stretch of coast in Tien Thanh Commune, about three kilometres
from the city of Phan Thiet. It is a desolate place with dozens of vast holes
in a row, some more than 100 metres deep and a few dozen hectares in area,
beautiful but treacherous. I discovered that bee-eaters, insect-eating birds,
come to this place to build their nests and lay eggs every year.  
There are 26 species of bee-eaters worldwide, with three species nesting in
Binh Thuan Province: Green bee-eaters (Merops orientalis), Blue-throated bee-
eaters (M. viridis) and chestnut-headed bee-eaters (M. leschenaulti).

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/b.jpg)

_Bee-eaters of Binh Thuan Province, Central Vietnam  
_  
Bee-eaters in Vietnam favour open country, bush and forest edges. However,
they need sandy cliffs to build their nest tunnels; with all the construction
in Vietnam, and subsequent digging for sand, many of the nesting sites are
under threat. On top of this, local people dig out the nests to get to the
eggs and nestlings.  
The birds use their beaks to dig holes penetrating one to one-and-a-half
metres in which to build their nests. Each female lays four or five eggs.  
In about June, the head bird of a group and the parents take their young into
the brush, and soon disperse.  
It is noisy and exciting when the bee-eaters come to nest and it becomes quiet
when they leave. I have been greeting and saying goodbye to them for years.
The numbers of nesting have been decreasing year by year, due to hunting,
which saddens me.

**Vietnam Heritage, June-July 2011 —** The land just above Mui Ne beach, near
Phan Thiet, had been taken over by â€˜resortsâ€™. Next in proximity to the
beach ran Nguyen Dinh Chieu Street, then, on the far side of it, restaurants,
grocery stores, coffee bars, souvenir shops, travel agencies and a few small
restaurants.  
From the street, I could not see the sea, or what looked like a public beach.
I felt I was being asked to think about staying at a resort with the works,
swimming pools, spa salons, hair salons and a restaurant with a continental
breakfast. The prices at the resorts ranged from $US50 to $US200.  
At Mui Ne [MÅ©i NÃ©, in Vietnamese], sand is everywhere. You can find it in
your camera. At the back edges of the beaches, they grow sheoak hedges and
trees to protect themselves from sand borne on the prevailing wind. When you
ride a bike, the wind makes you weave.  
Huge sand dunes further back from Mui Ne beach, â€˜resortsâ€™ and shops are
called flying dunes; the wind changes their shape every hour.  
Mui Ne sand is red in an area of ancient iron ore, white around the border
between Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan Provinces, black and red in Bong Lai Tien
Canh and yellow and brown on a certain part of the beach. Mui Ne sand has 18
tones.  
To explore the 18 tones, Jeeps are available. It costs about VND400,000 ($20)
for a trip in an open machine to Suoi Tien (Fairy Spring), Con Cat Do (Red
Sand Island) and Con Cat Trang (White Sand Island). [Cá»“n: island, cÃ¡t:
sand, Ä‘á»: red, tráº¯ng: white. These â€˜islandsâ€™ are not islands in the
sense of being completely surrounded by water.] Hot air coming from the sand
dunes blew my hair into a whirlwind during 30 kilometres in the hands of a
Phan Thiet driver.  
Suoi Tien is in Nguyen Dinh Chieu Street. We found a brook in a state of
neglect with a chain of stalaciform hillocks of sand hardened to stone by
wind. Clear water flowed over a bed of fine, rosy sand.  
A red sand dune was to be found a few kilometres from the centre of the
â€˜resortâ€™ area.  
Vast white sand dunes appeared 20 kilometres away, beside a lake of lotus
flowers on the side of which was a sparse forest of sheoaks. Prize-winning
photographs had been taken here.  
While Mui Ne waters are used for windsurfing [There are international
competitions], its sand dunes are used for sand-surfing. Children stood at a
parking space ready to rent out boards for VND20,000 ($1). Children on
horseback galloped up to us and asked if we wanted to hire a horse. None of
the people who carried boards could surf, but you could hire a â€˜guideâ€™. It
was hard to slide even a few metres, though the dune was immense.  
I complained to the owner of the sand-surfboard business that I hadnâ€™t done
any surfing. A boy standing nearby said, â€˜You can’t do the surfing without
hiring a â€œguideâ€.â€™  
I stayed at the resort two more days. It was a short walk to the beach. You
could lie on a bench and look at the moon and sky through sheoaks. You could
kindle a small fire. I ate sweet-smelling oyster soup and one-day-dried squid,
a local specialty.  
Late in the afternoon, the shops were crowded with tourists.  
The souvenirs included â€˜pearlsâ€™ so cheap one might have thought they were
not real. They were mostly of irregular shape, with many flaws. Along the
street were baskets of pearls, white, black and other colours. Pearls were
plaited into strings, long, short, big, small, single, double, in earrings,
fingerrings and necklaces. The prices went as low as a few dozen thousands of
dongs, for a ring. There were hundreds of pearl shops.  
I moved to the Ke Ga Lighthouse resort, about 30 kilometres south of the Phan
Thiet post office [whereas Mui Ne is a short drive from and on the other side
of Phan Thiet]. This â€˜resortâ€™ was in a quieter place, though the
â€˜resortsâ€™ occupied every metre along the beach. The Hana Beach Resort is
pretty large, with high-quality bungalows, and there is, in more space, the
high-class Princess dâ€™Annam. The lighthouse itself, more than 100 years old,
we got to in a coracle.  
I rented a motorbike from a watchman of the Hana Beach Resort to go to the
400-metre-high Ta Cu Mountain, near Thuan Nam Town, Ham Thuan Nam District,
Binh Thuan Province.  
On the way I saw the orchards of thanh long, dragon fruit, which were lit up
with electric light when the sun went down. The thanh long trees are favoured
by this area of sand, wind and light. The thanh long tree is not pretty, a
kind of cactus that bears not-so-pretty fruit, the taste of which is so good
many Californian Vietnamese grow them there.  
There were also fields of salt, and workers harvesting it in wheelbarrows.  
I reached Ta Cu Mountain at 5 p.m., wanting to visit the Sakyamuni Buddha
entering Paranirvana, which is 49 metres long and 4 metres high, in concrete
on a steel skeleton, built in 1963, close to the mountain-top. There is a
cable car, but I heard an operator say, â€˜Can you come back tomorrow?â€™
Alternatively, I could stay overnight on the mountain, including a vegetarian
meal.  
A big group of tourists arrived, however, and the-cable-car-operators agreed
to postpone closing time by an hour. I would see the statue before sunset.

_View from a patio on the first floor of the pagoda._

**Vietnam Heritage, June-July 2011 —** Just a short way down Mai Thá»‹ Lá»±u
Street and we have now crossed into Äa Kao Ward (no passport required). At
number 73 Mai Thá»‹ Lá»±u Street one finds perhaps Saigonâ€™s most colourful
and active pagoda â€“ the Jade Emperor Pagoda. The Vietnamese have two names
for this pagoda, ChÃ¹a PhÆ°á»›c HÃ£i, which means something like â€˜Pagoda of
Oceanic Happinessâ€™, and Äiá»‡n Ngá»c HoÃ ng, meaning Palace of the Jade
Emperor. Pagodas in Vietnam all owe a lot to Chinese culture. This one,
however, is a-hundred-per-cent Chinese in origin, founded by immigrants over a
century ago, according to my 2000 copy of The Rough Guide. No bright yellow
and red here. The outside walls are of a more subtle red pigment. It is the
same red as is used in Pekingâ€™s forbidden city and, as was explained to me
there, the colour is obtained from pigâ€™s blood.  
Behind these walls and a standard, tiled-roof gateway you first pass an area
that was given over to motorbike parking. Beyond this is a wide, deep
courtyard whose main feature is the sanctuary it affords to living things,
especially people sitting, soaking up the shade. A high aluminium structure
with wooden rafters has been erected over a circular pool, perhaps for shelter
from the rain. Here aloft perch pigeons. They feed on seed on the ground. This
brought back childhood memories of feeding these birds with breadcrumbs at
Canterbury Cathedral in England. In the fountain, carp, catfish and a few
turtles swirl. Two encaged tortoises, as symbols of longevity, were displayed
on a platform to the right. In addition, adjacent to the main hall, there was
a deep and large pool teeming with hundreds of turtles and some lobsters. I
watched them eagerly gobble up vegetation that people offered them. On the
wall of the pagoda there was explanation in Vietnamese of these creatures.

pagoda.jpg)

_Inside an outer sanctum of the Jade Emperor Pagoda  
_  
This pagoda was much more crowded than the temple to Tráº§n HÆ°ng Äáº¡o
[described below]. There were many more locals and, whilst I had had the
historical heroâ€™s temple to myself, here at the pagoda were groups of
tourists, both Asian and Caucasian, even one with a tour guide. I wonder if it
was to protect the latterâ€™s profession that no explanatory leaflet was
available, in, say, French, Japanese and English. I made do with my ear-bitten
Rough Guide.  
The etiquette of some of the visitors surprised me and there was no official
on hand to uphold standards. I have become Easternised and automatically take
off my shoes on entering a pagoda. Most of the locals brought their slippers
but the Westerners walked in with their shoes on. Most shocking of all, a
Vietnamese lass marched in with high-heel shoes and rump in the air. On a
previous visit to the pagoda there was even a monk with an incense stick in
his mouth. I believe it had been manufactured by Benson and Hedges.  
Once inside, everything was a feast for the senses. The building was of
concrete but inside wood, very old, was the main building material. The
mustiness of these beams, together with incense burns, provided a great
olfactory experience. The mix of Chinese mythology and religions made for a
great and highly varied visual display. On the altar there was a huge statue
of the Jade Emperor himself. He, like St Peter in Christianity, controls entry
into heaven. To his sides are further large statues, of the Four Big Diamonds,
guardians, and the Taoist gods of the polar stars. The guide book says the
Northern Star God represents longevity and the Southern happiness. To the left
there is another room with superb wooden carvings showing the punishments that
await evil-doers in each of the ten layers of hell. At the top of each of
these are the judges of hell holding a book describing the misdeeds. Lastly,
you should peek upstairs where there is a shrine to Quan Am, Goddess of Mercy,
to whom women make offerings for fertility.  
A world away from the luxury shopping malls and high class-hotels and
restaurants of downtown District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, but still within its
confines, one may find the down-to-earth wards of TÃ¢n Äá»‹nh and Äa Kao.
Anyone with half-a-day to spare who is interested in the real Vietnam might
consider a tour of the Jade Emperor pagoda, the temple to Tráº§n HÆ°ng Äáº¡o
and two communal houses all within a single, square half-mile.  
The quartet of colourful places of veneration renders a look at local life as
well as an insight into Vietnamese attitudes toward religion, or reverence,
that would be hard to encounter in more touristy areas. Furthermore, they
offer great variety. The temple is dedicated to a national hero who upheld the
country from existential threats. The pagoda is Disneyesque, a feast to the
senses. The two communal houses give a glimpse into neighbourhood commercial
and social activity, as well as reverence.  
I have used the usual translations of names in Vietnamese of the institutions
in designating them â€˜templeâ€™ (Ä‘á»n), â€˜pagodaâ€™ (chÃ¹a) or â€˜communal
houseâ€™ (Ä‘Ã¬nh). They all â€“ more or less â€“ venerate deities, saints or
heroes of various degrees, so it can be difficult for the uninitiated to
distinguish between them in any other way than using the usual translations of
the Vietnamese words that appear at the entrances.  
Getting physically to the colourful quartet â€“ and colourful quarter, for
that matter â€“ could not be easier. I got on a municipal bus in Hai BÃ TrÆ°ng
Street just opposite the Park Hyatt Hotel, and alighted on the same
thoroughfare ten minutes later at the entrance to LÃª VÄƒn TÃ¡m Park. You may
be in time to observe hordes of Vietnamese folk doing their own brisk-walking
morning exercise. And you may not be the only soul around in search of
sanctuary. In a previous â€˜incarnationâ€™ this was a French military cemetery
and stories of haunting abound. Cross the park and exit at the gates in VÃµ
Thá»‹ SÃ¡u Street. Cross the busy road and turn to the right. March for about
a hundred metres and you will reach what was my first port of call, at number
36 VÃµ Thá»‹ SÃ¡u Street.

charactersTRIMMED-8-June.jpg)

_Left: Pigeons on a frieze of glazed sculpture on the outside of the Jade
Emperor Pagoda. Right: Characters in the same glazed, sculptural style outside
above the entrance._

Onward now and on foot away from the park and eastward following VÃµ Thá»‹
SÃ¡u Street I crossed a couple of busy roads and came to Mai Thá»‹ Lá»±u
Street. This is an extremely crowded part of the city and traffic often
streams on to the pavement, so I would not blame you for not doing this as a
walking tour. You are in for close-up encounters with locals, cursing them as
they honk you to yield your pedestrian rights to their motorbikes, or various
interchanges with vendors as you negotiate the obstacle courses they have
placed in your way. All good physical and kinaesthetic fun.  
Along from the pagoda Mai Thá»‹ Lá»±u Street changes into Tráº§n Quang Kháº£i
Street, and, in yellow and red, here is the neighbourhood ÄÃ¬nh Nam ChÆ¡n, 29
Tráº§n Quang Kháº£i Street. Again the front of the courtyard is a motorbike
park. This was obviously a house of devotion, but it seemed deserted, so it
could only be assumed that this parking was not for worshippers but for
commercial reasons.  
This bright house also features wooden rafters on concrete pillars but it is
much newer. It seems to be dedicated to a female deity, judging by the statue
on the altar gaily flanked this time by white horses and cranes on turtleback.
To the left of the house is a large hall. When I visited it was full of youths
practising martial arts. Although I have seen Kung Fu Panda and had all this
explained to me I still find it hard to reconcile violent sport with peaceful
religion. However, this, to my mind, together with the traditional Vietnamese
apothecary at the right of the courtyard, adds to that lived-in charm of the
place.  
Sheer serendipity led to the second Ä‘Ã¬nh, or communal house, the smallest,
the most homely but also the strangest of the pack. I was heading back to
catch the bus when in the corner of my eye from a side street I saw red and
yellow again. Upon investigation I came across the ÄÃ¬nh SÆ¡n TrÃ , with
â€˜1950â€™ written on its facade. The address is 113A Nguyá»…n Phi Khanh
Street, TÃ¢n Äá»‹nh Ward; it is at the intersection with Huyá»n Quang
Street.

Right: A lion defender at the foot of the Tráº§n HÆ°ng Äáº¡o statue  
_  
Half the forecourt was like a buildersâ€™ merchantâ€™s yard. They were loading
up a truck with clinker when I appeared. Stepping into the house itself I
encountered serried motorbikes parked right up to the altar. This was still an
active place of reverence â€“ no attempt had been made to convert into
anything else. Why not go the whole hog, though, and stick a motorbike on the
altar and expand the dedication of the place? We could borrow a few statues of
the gods of hell, line the flanks with plaster casts of lacerated limbs with
holes and display wooden carvings of riders undergoing torments in hospital
accident wards.

11/20/2019,Hickory dickory dock in Hanoi,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/hickory-dickory-dock-in-hanoi/,,By Dang Ha Phuong,,,"**Vietnam Heritage, March 2011 —** On top of the Hanoi Post Office, near Hoan
Kiem Lake, is a four-faced clock that was given to Hanoi by the Chinese
Government and installed in 1978. It strikes at 6 a.m., noon and 6 p.m.  
The clock is powered by the electricity grid, except when there is a blackout.
It has a 1.35 metre-long hour-hand and a 1.65 metre-long minute-hand. It has
eight loudspeakers with a total 240W to broadcast the strikes.  
The clock operating room is on the ground floor of the post office. Ms Le Thi
Yen, one of the first operators, said there used to be hundreds of other
smaller clocks in other rooms of the building and in some public places around
the city. They were wired to the big clock and showed the same time. The
operating team had to take care of all the clocks and deal with breakdowns. No
small clocks are connected to the big one any more, as people can easily
obtain their own.  
â€˜In the past, all six operating unit members were women. We had to try to
fix all the problems. I even tried to find materials to repair the . . . glass
of the big clock,â€™ Ms Yen said.  
Nowadays the operating unit is made up of only two members, as it needs no
more.  
Mr Kieu Hong Van, who had been working there for ten years, said, â€˜We have
only adjusted the clock a few times, due to power cuts or when the clock is
too â€œexcitedâ€ and goes too fast, like it did at the flower festival in
late 2010.â€™ I understand that the latter event occurred after the battery
[to take over during blackouts] had just been charged. The four sides of the
clock ran very fast. Fortunately, it was in the evening and the operators shut
off the lights in the clock. Van said he had been on duty every New Yearâ€™s
Eve at the post office over the past several years in case there was a
problem.  
Ms Yen said, â€˜The clock looks simple but there is only one such clock in the
world. When it was installed, the expert said there was just one similar one
in Beijing. But I went to Beijing and couldnâ€™t find it, so I believe the
clock at Hanoi Post Office is the only one. There might be some similar ones
at provincial post offices but they used this clock as a model.â€™  
On Táº¿t eve, people go to the lake to celebrate and watch midnight approach
on the big clock. the New Year. They look at the clock to watch every minute
pass. It has been the same for 32 years. After the first five seconds of the
final minute of the old year, the song Ca Ngá»£i Há»“ Chá»§ Tá»‹ch (Sing
praise to President Ho) composed by Luu Huu Phuoc is played. Fireworks are set
off and Party and State officials read Táº¿t wishes to the people.

 **Vietnam Heritage, March 2011 —** Were the great economist Adam Smith alive
today he might be tempted to ascribe his famous line â€˜a nation of
shopkeepersâ€™ to the Vietnamese. There is no shortage of shops in downtown Ho
Chi Minh City, not to mention street vendors offering mementos of the
nationâ€™s heritage to the passing crowds. Choose a souvenir: an ivory opium
pipe perhaps or a poster from the independence struggle, how about a Zippo
lighter? Would sir like to select from a display of classic blue-and-white
faience from the ancient capital Hue? Madam look at my old notes and coins or
buy your instant stamp collection here. Most will question if these relics are
truly of the era or are just imitations for the tourist market. However, if
the price is right we walk away happy with our Vietnamese memorabilia.  
Few visitors will be aware of where much of this material is sourced or where
they need to go if they are looking for more genuine antiques. You will not
find the answer to this question from the information pamphlets available at
the Tourist Information Company. Indeed, when I asked a class of born and bred
Saigonese university students I was met with puzzled faces. One of the
smartest in the group advised me to, â€˜Go to the travel agent and purchase an
airline ticket to Hue.â€™  
Yet the answer to the question is simple and just a stone’s throw away from
the tourist thoroughfares. Just across the street from the renowned Ben Thanh
Market, which anyone who has been in the city for more than a day will at
least have passed by, there exists a small street called LÃª CÃ´ng Kiá»u. It
stretches for two hundred metres or so and every single house is or purports
to be an antique shop. This street is, in every sense of the word, a lane. It
is as quiet, unhurried and narrow a street as you will find in bustling
District 1. It lies like a village huddled beneath a castle. The castle in
this case is that great temple of Minerva, the Ho Chi Minh City Art Museum.  
The action begins at the mouth of Le Cong Kieu with three or four shops on
either side of the intersection with Pho Duc Chinh, the street where the
museum is. What does the lane have to offer? Most of the shops specialise
although the larger ones will have a range of wares on display. You can find
old watches and locks, brassware, gramophones with brass horns that could
grace the lobbies of one of the cityâ€™s Grand Old Dame hotels, radios and
some of the early film projectors, bronze figurines and ancient toys. There
are paintings, the inevitable chinaware, incense-burners and other religious
paraphernalia, both Buddhist and Christian, opium and water pipes, coins and
banknotes of French Indochine, beads and jewellery and jars and containers of
all description. Then there are stone carvings and engraved tablets of Champa
and also huge laterite busts of characters you last saw at Angkor Wat. A
couple of shops even deal in nothing more than lamp stands and shades. In
among the treasures you will of course find things that are out of place. For
instance, I spotted that most commonplace of souvenirs, a Chinese Tang Dynasty
horse, that looked as if it had been manufactured yesterday. I lived in China
for three years and I cannot tell you how many of these I had given to me as
gifts. On my first visit at the far end of the lane a number of pavement
vendors were selling what was obviously modern ceramic ware, much of it bright
yellow in colour. I subsequently noticed they had been ejected either by the
authorities or by the more legitimate tradesmen. What attracts you is of
course in the â€˜eye of the beholderâ€™. One man’s bric-a-brac is another
manâ€™s object dâ€™art.  
The shop owners and salesfolk themselves are an interesting breed. Not many of
them speak beyond a smattering of English. One lady had to call her child over
to do the interpreting. Judging by the many Mastercard and Visa signs, they
clearly want to attract overseas customers. It is interesting to note that
only one of the shops sells by fixed price and it has prices which are
labelled in American dollars. Not many of them, I suspect, have degrees in art
history. One suspects that the thing of greatest beauty to most would be the
ability to buy low and sell high in a market famous for its widespread
imperfect knowledge. I did however have one long conversation with a gentleman
who spoke impeccable English, and I read â€˜MBAâ€™ after his name on his
business card. He tried to sell me a metal Khmer bust he claimed was a hundred
years old for 110 USD plus stand that, as he put it, would have fitted nicely
in my suitcase. â€˜Discount for cash,â€™ he added as an enticement, explaining
that way avoided bank charges and an unfavourable exchange rate vis-a-vis the
free market one.  
On the days of my saunterings I did not notice many fellow browsers. Most of
those I did see were white Caucasians like myself. Conspicuously absent were
Asian folk such as the that nation of shoppers so noticeable in the more
conventional emporia of Saigon, the Japanese. Perhaps these kinds of articles
are not exotic enough for them. No doubt professional dealers from abroad are
well aware of this place but one would have thought the more casual visitor
might be easier to exact a healthy profit from. Perhaps, these merchants could
form an association and benefit from group advertising in order to put the
street more firmly on the map.  
One question we would all probably want to ask is how would one get the more
weightier objects back through customs to oneâ€™s home country? â€˜No
problemâ€™ was the general response. â€˜We ship for you.â€™ I have heard this
nonchalance before. Once when I was young and green someone sent me off with
some ivory knick-knacks with this line, only to have them impounded by
Malawian customs at the airport. I feigned interest in a huge Khmer bust.
â€˜Twenty-five kilos heavy and cost 800 dollars,â€™ I was informed. â€˜Yes,
but how do I get it back home?â€™ I asked the young salesgirl. â€˜We ship for
you.â€™ I posed as an American and enquired about getting it through US
customs. Would she help with all the documentation? â€˜No problem,â€™ she
said. â€˜This only three hundred years old, only problem if one thousand
years.â€™ I wondered if she had the pieceâ€™s birth certificate. There is no
doubt that these folk are well connected enough to sail through Vietnam
customs but getting an object into oneâ€™s own country would require very
careful research of oneâ€™s own, I would imagine. She enquired where I was
from in the States. New Mexico, I lied, and she produced a book with shipping
rates to just about everywhere on the planet. She also presented a sample
dossier of all the documentation needed to send a similar piece to the States.
Very impressive. In among the bill of lading, certificate of authentication,
and other papers was a gem of a document: a Certificate of Fumigation. Now,
that on its own and framed would make a great collectorâ€™s item.

April is in the rainy season on Mt Fansipan, the highest mountain in
Indochina, the time for amphibians to wake up after a long hibernation and
search for food, copulate and reproduce, and the most suitable time for
researchers like me to study the wildlife, collect specimens and perhaps
discover new species. Among the things I came across on a trip in April, 2009,
are the following:  
On a slope, a flower of the milkwort family (Polygalaceae), Polygala
tricornis, was blooming pink bells that quivered in a breeze.  
Black bamboo, Phyllostachys nigra, a plant listed in the Vietnam Red Book,
grew along paths.  
At an altitude of 1,900 m, I found a couple of small streams and some rather
wild forests. The main wood trees belonged to the beech family, Fagaceae, and
magnolia family, Magnoliaceae. Nearly 100 species of heather, Ericaceae, were
to be found on the mountain.  
In forest shade plenty of cardamoms, Amomum aromaticum, a valuable plant in
medicine and for its aroma, were blooming, which signaled a good crop for the
native people.  
High above, many species of orchids were showing their flowers. Coelogyne
fuscescens wore its bright orange flowers and Dendobium sp. its white ones
with a distinctive black dot in the middle of the labellum.  
Azalea bushes also displayed their beauties, in the pink of Rhododendron
klossii, red of Rhododendron tanastylum and pure white of the fragile petals
of Rhododendron sp.

_Bombina maxima, a small toad listed in Vietnamâ€™s Red Book, on a stump at
2,400 m on Mt Fansipan_

At an altitude of 2,400 m, a small toad, Bombina maxima, listed in Vietnamâ€™s
Red Book, appeared on a stump. This species lives between 2,000 m and 2,600 m.
Though I had photographed hundreds of amphibians and reptiles in Vietnam, this
was the first time I had seen this rare toad in nature.  
At 2,500 m, there was serious deforestation of the primitive forests, perhaps
due to ethnic-minority use of the land for cultivation. Many trees were
burned, black chunks and dwarf bamboo Bambusa sp. grew on most of the forest
areas.  
In a damp cave were primulas, Primula chapaensis, which grew only in the area
of Sapa and was listed in Vietnamâ€™s Red Book.  
Deep in another cave, the bright pink of Cymbidium lancifolium and purple of
Pleione grandiflora blended with each other.  
On a mossy mountainside were two strange species of azaleas I could not
identify by scientific names. For the moment I will call one a small-leaf,
dwarf rhododendron, Rhododendron sp., and the other a pink rhododendron,
Rhododendron chunii.  
I was surprised to see a barberry plant, Berberis wallichian, a very rare and
valuable medicinal plant that is listed in the Vietnam Red Book. This was the
first time in my ten years of research I had been able to photograph this
species and update my taxonomy web page (www.vncreatures.net) with it.  
Above 2,600 m, the trail was narrow, between two nearly vertical drops. The
sunset had an incredible beauty. A few minutes later, clouds covered the sky.
Darkness came with howling, cold wind and my group shook with cold. We had to
open our mouths to get a deep breath, due to the thin atmosphere at this
altitude.

_From left: Pleione grandiflora, found deep in a cave; another species of
azaleas temporarily called pink rhododendron, Rhododen; Rhododendron with pure
white in its petals  
_  
We reached 2,800 m at 8 p.m., almost exhausted after a whole day of climbing
that involved legs, arms, buttocks and even back pushing against the mountain.
Dinner was delicious noodles, rice, eggs, beef and chicken. Water boiled below
100 degrees C, at this altitude, so our food was not well done, at least not
in the same space of time.  
Our group, eleven, huddled in at least four layers of shirts and a raincoat.
[The accommodation was a tin hut.]  
When I woke up in the morning it was still raining. The wind shrieked through
the bamboo bushes. The light was dim because of haze. At 7.10 a.m., everyone
got up to have breakfast and prepare for the final journey, to the top, at
3,143 m.  
This was the highest breakfast ever for many of us.  
After more than two hours of heavy steps, at nearly 3,000 m, I heard the small
call of an animal. Experience told me there couldnâ€™t be any amphibians at
this altitude. But my heart told me something very strange.  
I listened, looked carefully, dug and searched. I almost cried from happiness
when I saw a couple of mountain toads mating and giving eggs. This species was
thought to be new one. Research was being done on its classification. I really
did not want to interrupt their fun but I had to take them as specimens for
research purposes. I had ever seen amphibians living at a higher altitude.  
We reached the top of Fansipan and screamed and yelled for having conquered
ourselves, while it rained and the wind howled.

_One of the Xin Man Rocks_

**Vietnam Heritage, March 2011 —** There is a group of inscribed rocks called
â€˜Xin Man Rocksâ€™ (ÄÃ¡ XÃ­n Máº§n, in Vietnamese, but probably from a local
language), in Nung Ma Lu Village, Nam Dan Commune, Xin Man District, in the
far northeastern province of Ha Giang, that Vietnamâ€™s Institute of
Archaeology says were inscribed about 2,000 years ago.  
The inscriptions are on nine large rocks and include representations of human
figures, feet and reproductive organs, circles and terraced rice fields.  
Also, pieces of rock were broken off.  
The Xin Man Rocks were discovered in 2005 and recognized by the Vietnamese
Government as National Archaeological Relics in 2008.  
They are deep in a valley below where Nam Dan Spring and terraced rice paddies
wind around a mountain and small stilt houses, half-hidden in clouds, sit on
the mountainside. The houses are the centre of Nam Dan Commune, bordering
China.  
The people are of five ethnicities: Nung, Hmong, Chinese, Kinh and Tay. The
Nung make up most of the population, with 2,724 people in 470 households. The
commune consists of 12 villages, ten entirely Nung.  
The Nung, who have been living there the longest, believe the universe is made
up of three parts: a holy fairy world, a world for human beings and an
underground. Their pantheon includes their ancestors, a kitchen god, forest
god, spring (water source) god and rock god.  
Nam Dan (Náº¥m Dáº©n), where the inscribed rocks are, is the only commune
among a number in the area that worships a rock god. On the second day of the
sixth lunar month, people set up an altar at the inscribed rocks to worship
the rock god.

nearby towns, like Kon Tum or Pleiku. Some still live far outside the confines
of  
development, but live a more sedentary life than their ancestors. However,
there are those who live the same way their people have for thousands of
years. The Bahnar Jo Long are still  
animists who worship the forest

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_6157-by-chris.jpg)

The sun went down and soon all that could be seen in the small, solitary hut
deep in the jungle of Kon Tum Province in the Central Highlands were faces
glowing orange from the flickering of a small cooking fire set in the bamboo
floor. The fire suddenly grew bigger and the hut was momentarily illuminated
enough to see a woman preparing a lizard to cook over the open flame and a man
swilling from a bamboo straw dipped in a clay jar full of wine. As the jar was
passed around the fire, everybody apparently began to feel the effects of the
sweet, low-alcohol drink, and the men began to sing a traditional Bahnar Jo
Long song.  
â€˜â€œToday we sit, because tomorrow we canâ€™t,â€ this is what they are
singing. They are very simple people,â€™ said Mr Nguyen Ngoc An, whom I had
hired as a guide and translator. Mr An is an artist who owns a cafÃ© in Kon
Tum, speaks the Bahnar language and is sympathetic to the Bahnar Jo Long way
of life.  
The Bahnar Jo Long, one of over 40 tribes who make up what the French called
the Montagnards, live off what they can find and grow in the forest and on the
slopes of mountains. This way of life is rare, even in the remote jungles of
Vietnam. Though they share the same lineage as the Bahnar living in Kon Tum,
the Bahnar Jo Long speak a different language.  
There are only about 300,000 Montagnards left in the Central Highlands,
according to the US-based Montagnard Foundation, which aims to preserve the
culture of the Montagnards. Many of the tribespeople have moved into nearby
towns, like Kon Tum or Pleiku. Some still live far outside the confines of
development, but live a more sedentary life than their ancestors. However,
there are those who live the same way their people have for thousands of
years.  
The Bahnar Jo Long, also called the Bahnar â€˜on the mountainâ€™ by other
tribes living in the area, is one of these groups. They live in the mountains
of the Central Highlands, about 70 kilometres northeast of Kon Tum in Kon Ray
District. Kon Tum Province saw heavy fighting during the war with America and
the mountains and hills still bear the scars of bombs and napalm.  
Life in a town or along the road is still difficult for the Montagnards, who
are viewed by many Vietnamese as a backward people, said Mr An, whom I relied
on for much of my background information.  
On our way to the Bahnar village at the base of the mountain range where the
Bahnar Jo Long live, Mr An and I pushed, rather than rode, due to a flat tire,
his motorbike along the winding road through the mountains. As we walked I
could see Bahnar villages along the road where they had planted cassava fields
up steep hills. Women climbed the slopes to dig up the roots of the cassava
plant, which they mainly sell to Chinese companies that use it for industrial
purposes. Though this is still not an easy life, at least it offers access to
medicine, schools and readily available food. These things, however, do not
concern the Bahnar Jo Long. They know how to live off the forest and to move
off the mountain would only put them in a helpless situation.  
Mr An had agreed to take me into the mountains of the Bahnar Jo Long in
December last year. He had advised me it would be a good idea to make my being
there known to the local police before we went into the mountains. I had
agreed, filled out some forms and given them to a young woman who delivered
them to the police station where paper exchanged hands. I never dealt with the
police directly and despite the large police and military presence I had seen
in the area, we were never stopped or questioned during the trip.  
Before we could trek through the jungle into the mountains, we had to meet
with the chief of the tribe. Mr Deng, 60, like most Montagnards, is short, no
more than 150 cm, and his dark, leathery skin covers the taut muscles of a
much younger man. As he led us through the jungle to the first group of Bahnar
we would stay with, he constantly scanned the jungle floor for bamboo shoots
to eat later that night.  
Like the rest of the Central Highlands, this area is much cooler than the low-
lying tropical areas of Vietnam. Despite the cool weather, the sun was still
harsh as we walked on a small trail through thick bamboo forest.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_6134-by-chris.jpg)

We walked along a ridge that overlooked where we had come from. From here it
gave a clear view of how the Bahnar Jo Long live.  
Scattered through the hills were small huts, at most three or four in one
spot. Around the huts were brown patches of dry rice fields. These Bahnar do
not usually grow rice in the paddies that are typical of lowland Vietnam. This
rice is grown more like corn, except they plant it on steep hills. The Bahnar
collect the rice by hand, working all day on the slopes of the mountain under
the brutal sun.  
The Banhar Jo Long plant other vegetables, like beans and corn, but they rely
mainly on what they find in the jungle. They set traps for small game like
weasels and rats and search the forest for insects and lizards. If they are
lucky, they may find a deer to shoot with a homemade crossbow, but that is
rare.  
From the ridge, it became apparent how the Bahnar Jo Long have survived in the
same mountains for generations. Next to one field of rice, there was an area
of jungle that looked newer than the tall, thick jungle in other areas. I was
told it was a field that had been abandoned about a year ago. They have always
practised a form of shifting cultivation, clearing one area of forest to grow
rice and corn for a couple of years, then abandoning it to let the jungle take
it back and moving to a new area.  
The first area we stayed at consisted of three bamboo huts with a family
living in each. When I entered the hut where I would stay for the night, the
father of the house was weaving an intricate basket. Four children, two half
naked, sat around the cooking fire placed in the bamboo floor. They were shy
at first, but when Mr An gave them some candy they warmed to us. The older
ones soon started to run around and compete for my attention and the attention
of my camera. A couple of times I had to resist the urge to stop the children
from throwing the candy wrappers into the cooking fire and inhaling the toxic
fumes that would fill the hut. Mr An explained that they â€˜feedâ€™ the fire
with trash so it doesnâ€™t get hungry and â€˜eatâ€™ their house.  
Later that night three families converged on my hostsâ€™ hut and we sat around
the fire and drank wine. Like the Vietnamese, the Bahnar are quick drinkers
and we were all drunk in no time. While we drank, they started to pass around
some meat that I had seen cooking over the fire since I had arrived. I had
been told that it was wild boar, but after eating a large portion, Mr An
corrected himself and said it was a weasel that had been caught in a trap. The
meat became more stringy and tough to chew when I was handed the next piece.  
After waking soon after sunrise and struggling against the effects of the
massive amount of wine we drank the night before, I noticed the son of the man
we were staying with running towards the house. He was dressed in a spotless
white shirt and black pants. A much different appearance than the previous
night when he wore his usual dirty, torn secondhand clothes with no shoes.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_6213-by-chris.jpg)

Mr An said the boy had walked the four hours down the mountain to the roadside
village to go to school, but had arrived late and been too shy to go in. Like
most Bahnar Jo Long, the boyâ€™s parents did not force or pressure their
children to attend school. What they learnt in school did not help them on the
mountain.  
Five of the familyâ€™s nine children were still young and lived with their
parents. The other four were already married and lived on different parts of
the mountain. They had been living in the same house for three years, but
would soon move to a different part of the mountain.  
Mr To, the father of the family, said their house was larger than most, and it
would take them two to three weeks to build another. Other families would help
and only expect some wine and meat afterward, and for the family to return the
favour.  
Though the tribe is widely dispersed across the mountains, they are a very
tight group. Most nights, they walk hours before sunset to go to the closest
house to drink wine and eat. After drinking for a while, they walk back
through the dark jungle to their families.  
Vietnam is known for its emphasis on family, but the Bahnar Jo Long would not
survive without close family ties. The parents teach the children how to
survive off the jungle at an early age, and expect the children to take care
of them when they are old.  
Mr Deng said about 660 Bahnar Jo Long live in the area. About half, including
Mr Deng, who acts as an intermediary with the local government, live along the
road and the other half live in the nearby mountains they call Kong Jo Lun.  
The next day, a Bahnar guide took us up to the top of the biggest mountain in
the area and through the densest part of forest. The jungle was too thick for
the sun to reach the ground and the walk up the steep mountain was cool. The
40-year-old Bahnar guide, Mr Tum, knows the forest well and led us through the
jungle without a trail to follow.  
Mr Tumâ€™s primary job is hunting. Big game like deer, tiger and guar have
almost completely vanished from the area, so Mr Tum goes after smaller prey.
As we walked up the mountain, we stopped several times as his dog scratched at
a log barking and whining at its owner. Each time, Mr Tum went to where the
dog was digging and used his hook-ended machete to dig up a 30 cm lizard,
something we ate that night.  
After about a two-hour hike, we reached an even more dense part of the forest
near the top of the mountain. Mr Tum called me over and as I walked towards
him, he hacked away a clump of vines and pointed to a large clay pot.  
Mr An said the pot was left over from a small village surrounded by rice
fields that was abandoned in this spot over 100 years ago. Now there is only
thick jungle with massive trees. The Bahnar come here to worship their
ancestors and the spirits of the forest. Unlike most of the Bahnar in the
area, who have converted to Christianity, the Bahnar Jo Long are still
animists who worship the forest. This area is especially sacred to them so
they do not cut down any trees or plant fields.  
However, many other people in the area do not make this distinction. As we
climbed further up the mountain, we started to hear screams coming from the
forest. As we had neared the shouting, I saw young men hitting buffalo with
bamboo lashes and yelling encouragement as the massive animals struggled to
pull huge ancient trees across the hill where the men had felled dozens of
them. I also saw they had milled some of the timber, with chainsaws, as I was
told.  
Immediately I recognized the excessively loud bantering of young Vietnamese
men. Bahnar tend to be polite to the point of shyness. They are very quiet,
even when drunk. As we stopped I noticed that some of the men had packs of
cigarettes and one had a cell phone. The Bahnar Jo Long canâ€™t afford cell
phones and smoke hand-rolled tobacco they grow in the jungle. These were not
Bahnar, but illegal loggers who were taking trees from the ancient forest the
Bahnar worship.  
When I asked Mr An why the Bahnar allow the loggers to cut down the trees, he
said, â€˜They donâ€™t like it, but they canâ€™t do anything.â€™  
Those who reported the logging, as sometimes happened, found their homes
burned down or their livestock killed in retaliation. Even the authorities
have trouble stopping the logging, since the area is not very accessible and
is difficult to regulate. So most of the Bahnar, Iâ€™m told, just try their
best to ignore the loggers.  
Kon Tum does not come close to Sapa as a cultural tourist destination, but
that may soon change. With restrictions eased, more and more tourists are
coming to the area and tour companies are broadening their tours to outlying
areas instead of just the immediate Bahnar villages around Kon Tum. Although
the Bahnar Jo Long are still virtually untouched by the modern world it may
not always be that way. Like many places in Vietnam and Asia they may become
just another sideshow on the tourist circuit.n

_Egret over the rain-enlivened Ho Xuan Huong_

**Vietnam Heritage, February 2011 —** By accident, the birds had returned to
the Dalat lake, in much greater numbers than had been seen for many a long
year. As the lake had been drained, and especially after it had rained
heavily, and the brown water was up to half-a-metre deep, the birds swooped
and fed joyfully. This was how bird life was meant to be lived, while in the
days of the almost blue, dead elegance of the lake, most of the birds had been
swan-shaped and actually pedal boats. We were warned, by signs standing in the
water, that we should not fish, though these signs, I am told, were there only
because someone had a prior right to the fish. A taxi-driver, this time,
several of them, confirmed that the city, this second half of October, 2010,
was heavily involved with the concept that the lake was being drained and
reconstructed, and industries moved away from upstream, so as it would not be
polluted. Curiously, on dry, cracked mud and grass where the water did not
reach, before it had rained so heavily, no one used a metal detector to
collect the hundreds of wedding rings that must have been flung in despair,
from behind the fluffy feathers of a swan on such a swan lake of a theatre. In
this the â€˜City of Love in the Southern Highlandsâ€™, a taxi-driver confirmed
that no one hankered over such booty, or gold bars hidden there by fleeing
French colonials or deposed mandarins.

It is very rare to get a picture of Vietnamâ€™s white egret (and one has to be
careful not to assume there is only one kind, or that this bird is exclusively
Vietnamese, even though the _con cÃ²_ , Vietnamese for white egret, is, as a
bird, one of Vietnamâ€™s most famous and revered, or even that an
ornithologist or birdwatcher will call it an egret), such a white egret as I
have photographed, almost by chance. White egrets usually get a red halo
around them (and spiders, butterflies and lizards are hard to get into focus)
on oneâ€™s black hunk of worn, battered and grimy digitations, lacking in
pixel power, hanging round the neck. It has to be a rather dull day, in the
light sense, and you have to get down wind of white egrets, so they donâ€™t
sense you and fly away. And they have got to be feeding on rarely revealed
delicacies of the lake-bed and having an exceptionally good time.
Unfortunately, one white egret otherwise captured pretty well, on the handrail
of a bridge, upstream, appeared to have a scarecrow with a conical hat hanging
from its beak, as such a thing was in the background. One should be careful
not to fall down the bank of the drained lake (called Há»“ XuÃ¢n HÆ°Æ¡ng, or
Lake of Fragrant Spring, as should be said much earlier), but there were seats
beside the bank facing the vast, drained fields where the birds played where
one could contemplate just how good civic administration would have to be to
arrange something more pleasing than wild grass and birds on an unplanned
plain after rain. Just donâ€™t do anything and you will be amazed at what can
be constructed by nature without an â€˜expensiveâ€™ permit, development plan,
contract or progam.

The water coming out of the taps was sometimes tinged with the same fresh,
golden brown of the water in the lake under reconstruction. A taxi-driver said
this was clean dirt and we didnâ€™t have to worry about it, though if we
washed a white towel in the hotel we found it might appear to be dirtier than
when we started, and in patches, where the fabric had filtered out the most
particles of the municipal mud, which no doubt has already been commercialized
at hot-mud springs with take-away plastic bags for facials. The water, despite
its dirty-clean status, could impart an awful, sickly smell to the bathroom,
which it had done, it seemed, at the bathroom of the venerable Long Hoa
restaurant (which restaurant was a topic one had to come to eventually in any
serious coverage of Dalat, because of the outstanding style and cuisine).

The grass smelled like grass when it is cut. This was no doubt the temperate-
climate grass the famous Dalat golf course (it would have a trade-mark name),
by the lake, rejoiced in, while in the lowlands there had to be a tropical
grass that did not smell like cut grass as we normally knew it, as no one had
yet cloned in for down there the special smell that exhilarated in the
aftermath. Dalat is showing itself good at gardens in the twee, irritating
sense of fetishised domains with paths laid down according to a pattern
designed to please an obsessive-compulsive swift on high but not someone who
wants to walk naturally or in a straight line instead of a semi-circle. The
hedges are like the plastic chairs in Saigon footpath eateries, miniaturised.
A mouse could get stuck in one but not a rabbit, which is in a way the inverse
of what happens in the Saigon cafÃ©, where the smaller the mammal you are the
less likely to get stuck. Dr Alexandre Yersin, immunologist, celebrated
pioneer of Nha Trang, down on the coast, and lover of Dalat, a hill station of
the French colonial era, has his statue in such a park, and his is a sternly
impressive face, chiseled, austere, and there would be a question as to
whether he would have tolerated what he saw around him if he had came to life.
â€˜Elves,â€™ he would probably have said. Round the corner from Yersin is a
lane where wedding carriages are parked and a few of the Dalat nags lounge.
The horses do seem to be better bred than in the past, no longer in their
conformation tumbled down so much toward their haunches. Yersin and the carts
and nags are in and by a park that is pretty large and has some pleasant
smells of flowers, though it would be truly something if allowed to grow a
little wilder for a few years.

If you followed the main canal â€“ in which the water was the same colour of
dissolved wedding rings and which allowed for fishing, in one case, with the
use of a light-blue mosquito net â€“ down below the dam you came after a few
kilometres to a classic recreation park with a grossly unfortunate horse that
had to stand between the shafts of a tiny romance chariot like a statue, its
feet on pads, waiting. The horse nodded off in a series of half-a-dozen jolts
of the head, affected by gravity, like a student in a lecture, then, at a
certain low angle, woke up and lifted its head back to an attentive position,
such as would be assumed by a painted, lead horse between the shafts of a cart
in a nursery in which there were also lead soldiers. There was in this park
also a concrete Asian bear on its hind legs and attached, as if in a circus,
to a chain, which turned out on closer inspection to be the chain of a fence
on a bridge. This was the kind of park that has hump bridges and toadstools
made of concrete in the style of artificial cake-decorating cream and painted
in a lot of colours. Good for children, no doubt, but rather bright,
otherwise. A peaceful, gloomier spot to sit could be found along a path to a
very adequate toilet block, as long as you did not look on the other side of
it, where rubbish cascaded the slope to the water flowing down from the park
and its falls, called the Cam Ly Falls. This sight could give one of those
feelings or realisations one sometimes has that are probably well enough
described as â€˜Robinson Crusoe momentsâ€™, in which you wonder what other
people get out of life if nature is not inhabited as if it mattered in the
least.

Five or six kilometres upstream of the famous, renovating Ho Xuan Huong was a
winery (or some of the works of a wine company, with the sign CÃ´ng Ty Thá»±c
Pháº©m LÃ¢m Äá»“ng PhÃ¢n XÆ°á»Ÿng RÆ°á»£u, Dalat Food Company Wine Division),
a taxi destination that could be used as an excuse to go somewhere more rural
in a city expected by at least one Vietnamese visitor, from Hanoi, to become
only more urban, with traffic jams and hanging pollution, as in the
countryâ€™s other cities. The works was among those said by a taxi-driver to
have been moved from the close watershed of the lake in order to save the lake
from pollution. The spectacle of clouds fleeting low over the high tableland
remains intact for now, however, and one should seek a room with view, in
Dalat, as it will invariably include the clouds. Strangely, given the enormous
hectarage given to horticulture in so many parts of the city, the prevailing
winds bring no whiff of agricultural chemicals, even if you can smell them at
some gardens if you get up close. When we alighted from the taxi at the
winery, on a drizzly afternoon, more immediately exciting was a vacant,
abandoned-as-a-habitation, French colonial building, which appeared to have
been a villa, of two storeys. It is the villas and the pine trees, which
deposit an eiderdown of needles on the hills, that make a large part of the
mysterious, haunted atmosphere of Dalat. The houses are often Gothic in style,
sometimes with a slightly risen, biscuity, Gingerbread Man look about the
facades and chimneys, and the young layout man for Vietnam Heritage, looking
at a photograph of one of the houses, remarked, â€˜Ghost houseâ€™. For most of
the 20th century Dalat was a French-colonial hill station and now the
officials and their good times have all returned to France or other
departments or territories beyond the sea. Out of Africa, in the case of
Baroness Karen von Blixen-Finecke, and out of Vietnam, for the French, but
seemingly little word of the delicious sigh of the film, â€˜Oh, I had a farm
in Africa,â€™ beyond the novels of Marguerite Duras, perhaps. The
architectural brilliance and wealth of the old buildings â€“ valued in their
run-down state, even, at half-a-million or a million US dollars apiece,
according to a vegetable-grower we visited â€“ and the circumstances of the
departure may have left quite different feelings. The conservation and uses of
the buildings â€“ vast in number â€“ is now a hot topic.

The Dalat Peopleâ€™s Committee House Management Centre, 11 Tran Hung Dao
Street, with a sign prominent at the front, with plenty of telephone numbers,
probably has a lot to do with Cadasa, an organization, a â€˜companyâ€™, in
charge of â€˜The revival of ancient villasâ€™ in Dalat, as it was put in a
placard about a photographic exhibition on Cadasa in Le Loi Street, Ho Chi
Minh City, in November. â€˜After a very long time, a cluster of ancient villas
. . . in ruins and abandonedâ€™ had been â€˜restored by Cadasaâ€™, the placard
said. The villas were at â€™16 Tran Hung Dao Streetâ€™. There is now such a
thing as â€˜Dalat Cadasa Resortâ€™, though it would appear to anyone who went
to the area that a major limitation on return from the rooms in the
â€˜resortâ€™ would be the usually heavy traffic in Tran Hung Dao Street, which
includes a very high proportion of large trucks, which do not stop for anyone
who wants to cross the road. I donâ€™t know whether the Dalat Peopleâ€™s
Committee House Management Centre has a say about all the French villas of
Dalat, beyond Tran Hung Dao Street, in which, in many cases, it appears poor
citizens live. These houses are often run down and installed with a ramp to
get motorbikes in the front door, several TV aerials and washing hanging out
the front. These suburban houses are kept up to some degree by the said
residents, no doubt. Some of the old villas, for example in Hoang Dieu Street,
are well kept up. What is happening to the three former palaces of the last
emperor, Bao Dai, is more mysterious and is dealt with by my colleague Vu
Huyen in a separate article. These buildings appeared to be in some kind of
architectural/administrative limbo.

There has been a tendency since mid-2009 in enterprises where direct
Vietnamese control can be exercised for roles previously played by foreign
experts, food-and-beverage managers, for example, to be handed over to
Vietnamese employees. One could theorise that â€˜knowledge-transferâ€™ had
worked, but in Dalat as elsewhere in the country, former foreign experts have
been alarmed, as the standards originally sought by the Vietnamese from
foreign experts have dropped, to return over time, perhaps, optimistically
speaking. The Sofitel Dalat Palace Hotel was recently taken over, and I
received a press statement about this in which the English was well below
five-star, when the hotel used to be top-class. We were told the rooms were to
be renovated, though we had imagined the hotel to be the last word in style. I
had stayed there. Were they going to straighten the fire dogs, or do something
horrifying like install heating other than wood fires? Cadasa could be seen as
part of a Vietnamising policy. We found the food and beverage of the
restaurant, at No 22, Tran Hung Dao, I think, to be good but the service
requiring of an extraordinary tolerance.

Dalat is the vegetable-growing capital of Vietnam and â€˜Dalat vegetablesâ€™,
because of the altitude, above 1,500 m, has become a byword. A year or two ago
you could go high on the plateau in the city and visit a flower- or vegetable-
growing area where there was a vile chemical smell that buyers in the city
would not have associated with the carnations they prized the freshness of, as
if the pollution had been brushed away by the brisk truck trip down the
mountain in fog. The blithely made reputation for salubriousness of Dalat
horticulture was in jeopardy. This autumn a lot of importance was put on
enormous nylon tents, which could be 50 m across, that composed the
greenhouses. Dalat was involved not only with the notion that the lake was
being cleansed but that the nylons tents would keep insects out (certainly the
material seemed fine enough), obviating the need for pesticides. There was
hope that now a â€˜Dalat green saladâ€™ might have something of substance â€“
natural, not artificial â€“ to it. You could walk straight in the door of the
greenhouse of the grower we visited â€“ just as you can walk into the yard of
any salt-of-the-earth Vietnamese house â€“ and sniff about. It was hard to see
why insects also could not just walk or fly in the door of the greenhouse, as
it was kept open, but the farmer woman assured us the ruffled sea of lettuces
was coming up this even green and saleable in the market at $US2 a kilo, a
price especially strong because of floods in Central Vietnam, purely under the
influence of recycled material as fertilizer, maybe composted. The serious
gastronome has a lot to think about and to investigate if he or she is to
reach a useful conclusion. And then, just as hope arises, there may be the
usual backsliding, deception and resting on laurels that come with the sense
you get in Vietnam of two steps forward and one step
back.![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vnhttp://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_2225-Vacant-

_A quite hill in Dalat_

On a pine-clad hill behind the works a man on a motorbike was taking
strawberries to market and a road on the other side had a covered drain beside
it highlighted in bright-green moss. A dark rectangle of a hole replaced one
or a few of the slabs of concrete covering. One reason for mentioning this is
that Dalat could alternatively be called the â€˜City of Roadside Drains
Missing their Lidsâ€™. Perhaps this is to let the fresh air in, but you need
to watch out your leg or whole self does not go in. We were in the vicinity of
a small lake called Ho Than Tho. The popularity of science and chemical
analysis has pushed back the use of the human nose in areas other than wine-
tasting, and sniffer dogs and sniffer rats are trained up, but in fact the
polluted can be distinguished from the unpolluted by the use of the nose. One
can tell whether a canal is dead or alive this way, however much stuff has
been dumped in it. A kilometre back toward the centre of Dalat from the above-
mentioned, pleasant lettuce garden there were smaller vegetable gardens in the
same â€˜nylonâ€™-tent manner, but with drains in front of them stinking of
agricultural chemicals. Even closer to Dalat there were fields of cabbages the
leaves of which were almost weighed down by the amount of white powder on
them. Of course one can imagine the force with which caterpillars might attack
a completely natural Dalat green, if you have tried a â€˜salad trá»™nâ€™,
mixed salad, at the Long Hoa restaurant or the _DÃ£ QÃ¹y_ , in the next
street. There is an unmistakable scrumptiousness to the green you donâ€™t get
in Saigon, notwithstanding that one would have to consider that appetite might
have something to do with it, since a Dalat day with a decent walk needs three
times as much victualling as a day at the office in downtown Saigon, where
going for a walk is now as fanciful as a limestone beast posted at the door of
a pagoda.

You can still walk around Dalatâ€™s suburbs in reasonable safety from traffic
and its exhaust pollution, and it is worthwhile to head for the two white
Buddhas on the skyline to the north of the centre, in the general direction of
the spectacular horizon that is Mt Lang Biang. Walk down the steep westerner
street, Truong Cong Dinh, and descend from it to the left and cross to the
other side of Phan Dinh Phung Street. Not far along to the north-west you come
to the Pho Viet restaurant for something very apt to walking around Dalat,
some of the most professional pho in the country. So much did they want to get
what they did right that they concentrated on beef pho and eschewed chicken
pho. There was no MSG. The chilli sauce and the bean sauce were in plastic
squeeze bottles on the table. There were also small jars of homemade yoghurt
and plastic containers of homemade crÃ¨me caramel. There were testimonials
from round the world on plates attached to the wall. If you couldnâ€™t find
this place on foot, a taxi was VND25,000 to VND30,000 from Dalatâ€™s central
market. Not far past Pho Viet, on the other side of the road, was a temple up
steep steps and paths, with the name Lien Hoa Bao Thap. As usual at Vietnamese
temples, the cleanliness and care taken with the enormous amount of space was
a reminder of decency and rightness. The temple had a huge, new bell, in its
own house at ground-level, with a knocker like a polished, slightly cigar-
shaped battering ram suspended from the roof on a wire cable. The Sakyamuni
Buddha also was huge, a standing supplicant reaching only to the statueâ€™s
knee-height. A blue-green lizard, perhaps made of cement, clung to a cement
rock big enough for a disciple of the same proportions as the Buddha to have
sat on. Beware a man cutting the beautiful-smelling grass with a whipping
cutter and a tumble on to a concrete path from a level not bounded with a
fence. You could push on on this path beyond the temple in the direction of
the mountain and the white, sitting Buddhas.

A sign saying â€˜House and land for saleâ€™ on another piece of French
architecture, though a fairly plain one, tickled the question of whether
foreigners can own land in Vietnam, for, as I understand it, they can own the
house but not the land. A lot of foreigners would be interested in buying and
restoring a run-down French villa, like the one near the winery, and,
according to my theory, the government might want the land back and the owner
of the bricks and stone and timber might have to ship them out on a truck and
barge, or give them up, as the original French did, though no doubt this time
it would be with compensation. An alternative might be to rifle the French
archives, here or in France, for the old designs of the inspired architects.
It is hard to imagine France or any other French department or territory
overseas ever had better villas. Vegetable plots mingled into the suburbs and
beside the road we came to a shop similar to a chemistâ€™s with as many little
bottles but containing what looked like powerful agricultural chemicals on
shelves at the back wall and sun-faded (to the common pale blue colour of
fading in Vietnam) boxes of no doubt similar preparations behind the glass of
the counter. To get to the Buddha we could cross a valley for several hundred
metres, between vegetable fields. The smell of the fields was not especially
vile, but it was not pleasing, not like cut grass or a live stream.

We by-passed the closer of the two white, sitting Buddhas in favour of much
bigger one a kilometre on, on the way stopping for something to eat at a
somewhat civilised-looking cafe. There was a young white man for a customer,
who said he rarely saw a white person in the area. There was a student
residence attached to Dalat University, where the young man taught. Having
eaten a very salt-of-the-earth dish that I recognised and had avoided in the
past, and salad, it was not long before I was swooning under the sun and I
moved inside, opening a little plastic bottle of yellow, sugar-coated Berberal
pills (which must be Vietnamâ€™s most useful minor medicine for foreigners)
and knocking back the maximum eight. I was right again in five minutes. The
other diners included a pair of brassy tarts who must have worked in a
hairdresserâ€™s. Perhaps feeling too much beneficent well-being after avoiding
big stomach trouble and having drunk a very reviving, oozy cup of Vietnamese
coffee, one could have been a sitting, or slowly wandering, duck for an up-
market souvenir shop selling Dalat and otherwise Vietnamese specialities on a
corner close to a road that led from the rear to the very large white, sitting
Buddha. Because you have not yet seen the Buddha, you may think the shop is an
ordinary, salt-of-the-earth one with decent prices. The shop, Quynh Nhu, at
126 Phu Dong Thien Vuong, welcomed customers with the view of two life-size
foreigner dummies wearing garments in traditional Vietnamese style, with
buttons made of knots. The man dummy was he who is probably known to many as
â€˜The Manâ€™, from a mould the location of which I do not know, but which
must have produced many thousands of copies, in the style of a very serious
business person who may have smoked Peter Stuyvesant when he went off the
rails for a few minutes at a garden party in his youth. Shopping in Dalat is a
separate story, which also you have to come
to.![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vnhttp://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_2402-Buddha-

_Buddha and dragons amid the Lien Hoa Bao Thap_

We approached the great Buddha of the Thiá»n Viá»‡n Váº¡n Háº¡nh monastery
from the road, which led toward the back of the 28.5-m-high statue, from which
angle it seemed the Buddha had a large electric fan at his back, which was in
fact the halo that would light up at night. Near the entrance to the road we
bought boiled corn cobs from an itinerant vendor but immediately spat out the
first bite when we found they had been cooked in water containing an additive
and hurled the cobs into a dirt gutter. In a few minutes we reached the front
of the north-facing Buddha, who inspired joy, especially by the way he held a
lotus up in front of him and gleamed white, the white set off magnificently by
bushy, healthy, thickly needled, dark-green, brushy pine branches that seemed,
viewed from the ground, almost to touch his face. A less athletic, supremely
jovial version of the Buddha sat beside a path, the head level with a passer-
byâ€™s head, which invoked a sense of dialogue. Guarding the temple were two
identical flesh-and-blood dogs, which, instead of standing to attention, were
sleeping in identical poses, as if practising synchronised sleeping. In the
Buddhaâ€™s large, treed domain was an enormous dragon with outstanding clawed
feet lashing the air among the foliage. You could sit on the apron of the
temple and listen to chanting coming from inside. We were in Dalat in the low
season, and we met almost no one doing what we were doing, at this temple or
anywhere else.

Wandering not far from the centre of Dalat, but always taking the road or lane
pointing higher, we came to a vacant block of land, with several low, bushy
pine trees on it and wildflowers among long grass. We could lie on our backs
on our ponchos, with backpacks for pillows, and look at the clouds and pine
branches. Loads of rubbish were brought up the small lane we had left, and
building materials taken down, on a gigantic truck. It turned out we had lain
on a faint path through the grass and a young man tramped through, missing us
by inches, representing a different state of mind, probably of broken masonry
and not vapour or chlorophyll. We would have appeared hippies reverting to
type, thinking back 30 years to John Lennon, such people as are only seen in
Vietnam in the form of student layabouts in Hanoi with a heightened sense of
entitlement. We were not subject to a plan or policy. Here is the place to
note that I do not think that the â€˜conservationâ€™ of heritage, for example,
the Dalat villas and palaces, is automatically a good thing. It depends on how
well it is done. The ravages of rain and gravity are natural, after all, and
hence hard to beat as things humans like.

broad shoulders came up Bai Sao (Star Beach) and asked whether there was a
place he could socialize, a bar or some such, on the island. He was well-
mannered, with a working-class English accent. The need for a pub could not
have been put better, or seemed more reasonable. We asked him some questions.
He had arrived on a boat from Cambodia at An Thoi, the second town, only a few
hours earlier, but determined already, having visited the main town, Duong
Dong, twenty-something kilometres north-east from Bai Sao, that, â€˜This is a
very quiet island.â€™ The island was Phu Quoc, Vietnamâ€™s future playground
of the rich, apparently, off the southern, west-facing part of the countryâ€™s
mainland and part of Kien Giang Province.  
The Englishman, whose possibly Cambodian woman companion stood a little to the
side and behind, also wanted to know if there was a place to sleep. We could
only suggest he ask about further; we had booked a place for the following
night and suggested he try there, a few hundred metres away, near the southern
end of the beach, at the Ai Si Hotel, which, though we did not know it at the
time, would become the centre of our Phu Quoc adventure. The day after our
return to the mainland, I read in the Viet Nam News that â€˜More than 70
guitars belonging to the legendary British music icon Eric Claptonâ€™ were
being sold in aid of his drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre in Antigua.
The Ai Si Hotel could well become both legendary and iconic, in its very
particular way, to our band of three holidaymakers, and others, no doubt. On
Phu Quoc, as elsewhere, these days, there are those who want things to become
legendary and iconic before they go through the stage of realness. We had been
there at the time of realness of the Ai Si.

at-Bai-Sao-By-James.jpg)

I had had an inkling things would go well at Bai Sao while we were still at
the Mango Bay Resort, north along the opposite, western, coast of the island,
beyond Duong Dong. To say that Mango Bay Resort was more up-market is true but
ridiculous, so much are the two places worlds apart. MBR is a must to record,
however. It is, and has been for a long while, perhaps the place in Vietnam
holidaymaking best at showing that many guests will pay more for having fewer
of the banal, knee-jerk facilities like telephone (none in the room, at MBR),
fridge (none in the room, just a wooden ice chest) or air-con (there is
plenty, but it is not electric and its breeze is powered by the alternation of
day and night that draws air on and off the island). In the MBR dining
pavilion the waiters wear jeans, not pomp, and the focus is on the food, which
is of the kind the Admirable Crighton, if you remember the film, or even the
play, might have served to Robinson Crusoe, such as fish barbecued in banana
leaf. We stayed in a â€˜Plantation Bungalowâ€™, which sums up the spaciousness
of MBRâ€™s seaside domain, which is cropped by cows wearing almost tinkling
wooden bells. While the sound of the bells as the herd did its round near your
Max Havelaar-style bungalow, if you remember the book and film, was the sonic
motif of MBR, the gobble of turkeys was the motif of the Ai Si.  
The car south was intercepted by another, because it had taken some wrong
baggage, and when we rang ahead to ask Ai Si (a name that at first flush could
be taken to refer to the temperature of their beer) to take special care to
wash the mosquito nets our room had been given over to another or others,
possibly the Englishman and companion. This was the holidayâ€™s what-the-hell
moment and we were really living, going to stay at Bai Sao anyway. The salt-
of-the-earth Phu Quoc people really live, and it seems that in reality you can
move in when you arrive and move out when you leave, if a room exists, and not
worry about such surrealisms as bookings or saying you are extending your
stay. We were about to enter the high period of what our own guest, the third
in our party, who came to be called â€˜the Astronomer Royalâ€™, would call, in
the middle of the night, â€˜the holiday from hellâ€™. I was later willing to
bet he was on his back in his cosy hotel in Pham Ngu Lao Street, Saigon,
saying to himself, â€˜I am not going to forget what they [his friends and
hosts or companions] did to me on Phu Quoc.â€™ He muttered on the way to the
Phu Quoc airport, â€˜How could you write this in a magazine? It would take a
400-page book.â€™

James.jpg)

Perhaps one is biased towards oneâ€™s own experience in the description of a
holiday and it is salutary to look at it vicariously, through the eyes of a
scientist such as the Astronomer Royal of Star Beach. Either because we had
been forced to bed so early, around 7 p.m., or because we had been forced
awake by one or more of the strangenesses or amazements of the Ai Si, we got
to talking about the stars, which he had last seen 30 years before, or so he
said, so paradoxically. Then we lit on something in the sky that he reckoned
was a nebula or a cluster of three things and which we eventually worked out
was the morning star, or the planet Venus, straight out over the sea. I tried
to take some pictures of it, but could not hold the camera still enough to get
anything much less jagged and irregular than the tiled staircases we had
mastered in getting up to the first floor and our room and the patio that
faced over the sea. The Astronomer Royal had the idea of reassembling one of
the three disintegrated, slatted banana chairs to use as a rest for my camera,
as it seemed to have the right angle for the morning star. This did not work,
but by this time we had worked out that Bai (Beach) Sao (Star) was probably
named after the very star we were aiming at.  
Although the hotel was not particularly old it was by far the most atmospheric
place on the beach. When the elder master of the Ai Si lit incense each night
on the prayer table at the front of the patio, we realized we were standing at
the very locus of the Bai Sao genius, and perhaps the Phu Quoc one, a genius
worth contemplating. If you get taken in by a Phu Quoc family (in the nicest
way) you are truly in and no one would think of doing you ill. It made me
recall a trip to a town called Tennant Creek, in Central Australia, where
people when they went out not only did not lock their front doors but left
them chocked open. If you can tell a person by the canine friends he keeps, it
is predictable that the Phu Quoc humans are good-natured and well mannered.
The dogs, by the way, are not just the Phu Quoc breed; Phu Quoc is a canine
Camelot. The Phu Quocan humans are generous and open. When the
â€˜international airportâ€™, the site for which a taxi-driver pointed out,
arrives, and if it employs the local people, guests will be able to pack with
vastly more confidence. The Astronomer Royal suddenly discovered he had two
keys to our room, and further, that these keys fitted any other room in the
place that he tried, and the key that fitted our room best was one that he
thought supposedly belonged to another room. The windows could not be locked
at all. On the other hand, I did hear that a door to the house, downstairs,
was locked at night. This phenomenon of the transferability of keys the
Astronomer Royal likened to that, observable at the Ai Si and common with all
the old, yellow sockets in Vietnam, in which the electrical thing your are
plugging in fits so easily that it has no purchase on the current inside and,
for example, recharging a phone or batteries only works if you practise
abnormal perseverance.  
The general decrepitation that had occurred in not many years was what was
most impressive and memorable (once we had survived, no gainsaying) â€“ and
was, as I will venture, the most significant sign to the future of Phu Quoc
â€“ and the particulars were less so, though some of them are worth reciting.
Again I will use the Astronomer Royal as yardstick, starting with the very
sticks, cut from the forest, from which in our rooms of the first night
mosquito nets were suspended like white and pink fish on rods and lines. He
considered these bucolic, at best. He was shocked by the noise when the staff
started the diesel engine that generated the electricity, though he got used
to it and came to appreciate it when (a) he could he get his phone or
recharger into potentially live contact and (b) the 120 volts of potential was
realized because the engine was running and or the hotelâ€™s batteries were
being applied to his needs. The water, which was from a well and reeked in a
common Vietnamese well way, would flow more often than not, and when it did we
filled a bucket for when it didnâ€™t. The basins did not have outlet pipes,
though they had plugs, which, when pulled, dropped the water on top of the
lidded garbage bins. One of them also came out bringing with it the rim of the
plughole.  
The shade in the bathroom of our eventual, three-night bedroom had obviously
at some time been brightened with a window cut with a circular saw in the
single-brick, cement-faced wall. As I would come to realize, the hotel would
need to last only as long as what I will call Phu Quocâ€™s rustic era did.
When a downpour thumped the tin roof and rainwater built up in a fold of blue
plastic liner in a roof where day guests had arrived for lunch, I watched the
elder master stand on a chair and stab the bulge with a carving knife and
spume the water into a bucket. The salt air had, over the eight years of Ai
Si, gently entered and exploded the cement balusters of the French-style
staircases and patio, and some of the shards lay where they had fallen, like
skittles. The word from many mouths on the island was that every present
manmade thing on many of the prettiest parts of the coast was on the way out,
to make way for five- and seven-star hotels and at least one casino. One of
the authorities on this was Ai Siâ€™s elder master, who referred to the rating
stars, and one the master (with his wife) of the esteemed Bo Resort, near MBR,
at Ong Lang, who referred to a casino.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/PQ1.jpg)

So, my thesis is that the star of Bai Sao, probably the most beautiful spot on
Phu Quoc and symbolic of the island, the star in the sky, is to be outshone,
according to very different astronomersâ€™ charts, by the stars in brass
beside the doors of hotels and that the island is now in a period of mystery
and suspense peopled by such as the hopeful but perhaps early â€“ it was
around the beginning of March, 2011 â€“ Englishman from Cambodia. Who knows?
Would he be the sort of person to be attracted to the prevailing, particularly
at Mui Ne (in southern Central Vietnam), view of developed beach
holidaymaking, in which the sea tends â€“ fact of life â€“ to be used more or
less for sewage-disposal and is replaced, for those who want to swim, with a
chlorinated infinity pool? As I waited to pick up our suitcase at Ton Son
Nhat, I photographed an advertisement for a Mui Ne resort with
Reckittâ€™s-blue pool water appearing to lap as high as the equally blue sea
beyond. Would the groundling astronomers take over Bai Sao, and Ong Lang, and
other natural environments of Phu Quoc? Could this be compensated for by the
provision of such things as brown-bread salad sandwiches with Dalat lettuce
and tomato, butter from New Zealand, cheese from Bega, New South Wales, and
ham from Parma, served with a small dish of first-cold-pressed olive oil?  
We were supplied at the Ai Si with a battery-powered (or did it have a monster
glow worm in it?) lamp that was too bright to look at but which threw very
little light on anything around it. During our last night I got up saying to
myself â€˜Point Percy at the porcelain.â€™ Odd, I thought, but in I went to
the bathroom, by the slight glow from the lamp on the table in the bedroom. I
fired determinedly at the gloom of the bowl, but kept getting ricocheted in
the shins. Of course, the Astronomer Royal had been before me, and put the lid
down, and I had pointed at the plastic. And some time before that I must have
heard him in my sleep go to the bathroom and I must have tried as if in a
dream to warn myself with the alliterative line. The astronomer had revealed,
as the morning light surrounded the star, that he thought of adventure not in
such things as plastic versus porcelain but rather as something like what he
had once encountered in Indonesia, something I dare say more legendary and
iconic, where he been able to speak the language, and had been last-minute,
impromptu guest of honour at a village headmanâ€™s wifeâ€™s funeral, where he
had been handed the lionâ€™s share of a liver, raw. A few days after our
return to the mainland, the Astronomer Royal told me he had bought a bottle of
gin and systematically called up and deleted the worst memories of the
adventure from his nervous system. And yet he also averred he would never want
to stay in a seven- or even five-star hotel or resort. He was betwixt and
between, like most of the foreigners we saw at Bai Sao â€“ rather, if one were
to guess, like the Englishman off the boat from Cambodia.

11/20/2019,Voodoo on a boat to Phu Quoc,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/voodoo-on-a-boat-to-phu-quoc/,,Text and Picture by James Gordon,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/TRavel.jpg,"Around the middle of the day on 20 June (the date is recorded on my
photographs), I boarded a large _speedboat â€“ it had seats numbered to over
100 â€“ in a coastal town called Ha Tien, close to the Cambodian border, in
far-south-western Vietnam. The boat was called the Hong Tam 2 and it covered a
one-and-a-half-hour route roughly west to the eastern coast of the island of
Phu Quoc, the largest island in Vietnam. This trip of ours was, crucially, an
example of travelling on water in Vietnam, or, for that matter, just floating
on water in Vietnam, including overnighting in a boat moored in Vietnam; we
have this year been horrified, saddened and angered by an event in this
category on Ha Long Bay, involving a tourist cruise boat and the deaths of
foreign visitors. I suggest there is a spiritual issue that needs to be
considered as a contributor to transport disasters and disastrous accident
statistics in Vietnam.  
In the single, large passenger cabin of the boat for Phu Quoc I had a sense of
something like what galley slaves might have felt on the Mediterranean Sea if
they had not been able to poke their oars out and there had not been plenty of
air. This is what I noted, flippantly, before I read about the Bulgaria
disaster on the Volga, which happened in the first part of July. I do not
write so lightly now. Yes, no doubt I was still affected in my sensibility by
the event on Ha Long Bay. I accept that another person in exactly the same
situation on the Hong Tam 2 might have been perfectly happy. And I did see a
happy face when we arrived at a long jetty along which we would walk to terra
firma Phu Quoc, on a member of the crew, if I am right. It lasted till I asked
its owner why the lifejackets under the seats were not of the same variety as
those on an instruction placard on the front and back walls of the cabin.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/TRavel.jpg)

The Bulgaria was a message that I had something to write and it was serious. I
have been pressed by stories before; I know what I have to do, which is, as an
old journalist said, â€˜Put it out of its misery.â€™ This is a miserable story
and no mistake, if I report it to you the way it seems to me, despite the view
of my â€˜criticâ€™, who comes in below. The windows on the Hong Tam 2 seemed
to me to be, and probably were, nearly all, unopenable. I noted that I
imagined that in an emergency smashing the windows might be required. There
was no notice posted on the walls, that I could see, about such drill. Now
many of us would have read that smashing the windows had to be done on the
Bulgaria, and that a great many, including a great many children, drowned
because they were unable to escape the old cruise boat.  
Because the Hong Tam 2 was a speedboat, though a very large one, and as one of
my photographs shows, it was not appropriate for passengers to be outside the
cabin in the way that it is appropriate on a leisurely Sydney Harbour ferry,
for example. So the most likely way to jump into the sea in an emergency was
via one of the front doors on either side or by going to a lateral passage at
the back that was open to the outside. The front doors were shut tight by the
crew, and no instructions were issued, that I noticed, to passengers as to how
to open these doors. Only when examining my photographs of the outside of the
boat later did I notice a sign saying Cá»­a thoÃ¡t hiá»ƒm, which means
â€˜Emergency exitâ€™, on a window. It was partially obscured by a curtain.  
I had been on a hydrofoil on the Saigon River when it hit a 40-foot cargo boat
and sent it to the bottom so quickly that only a few of the passengers on the
hydrofoil were able to report what had happened, apart from that there had
been a loud bang and the deck of the hydrofoil had been ruptured from below.
In the 13 July edition of the International Herald Tribune, in reference to
the Bulgaria, came the headline, â€˜Within minutes, no chance of escapeâ€™.
Precisely. In my view, the way to be on a boat is with access to the sea and
with a lifejacket not just under the seat but on your body.  
On the Hong Tam 2, before we cast off, I tried to pull the lifejacket out from
under my seat. It was hard to get out. It was wrapped in transparent plastic,
which did not help: the lifejacket kept to a block-like shape and was unable
to flex in order to come out of the rack. A young, female attendant said I was
not permitted to take the lifejacket out. I asked her how I was supposed to
know how to use the thing in an emergency. After a fair beginning of a minute,
literally, a very long time in an emergency, I had the jacket out. I asked my
wife, who was next to me, whether she knew how to turn on a signaling light
that hung from it by a string. She said she did not. The young attendant
showed us. It did not cross my mind that the lifejacket might be demonstrated
to the 60-odd passengers, as it is on an airliner, and neither was it.  
The lifejackets under the seats, mostly wrapped in transparent plastic, were
bright orange, instead of the rusty brown in the pictures on the walls. At
some point in the debacle I asked the young, female attendant why the jackets
we had were not the same as those in the pictures. Her eyes moistened. I
thought she was starting to cry and members of the family group I was
travelling with indicated that I was right and it was time to desist.  
I asked a young, male attendant to see if he could pull the lifejacket out
from under the seat of another member of our party. He struggled as much as I
had, to the point where I said, â€˜Hurry up, hurry up,â€™ as if there had been
a real emergency. This was taken by an overseas Vietnamese member of our group
as my verbally belabouring someone in a bout of, say, cross-cultural
dissonance. This critic maintained that the crew would have perfectly good
ways of their own of saving us in an emergency. It would have been obvious to
the critic that I had no clue as to what ways these would be. I think these
ways ought to have been advertised on the walls, or issued to each passenger
in a handbill. My critic was not about to elaborate. One of our group was a
Vietnamese journalist, who, when she discussed the lifejackets with the young,
male attendant, received answers or statements that to her showed he had
little idea of their use in an emergency. The journalist, a Christian convert,
which may become relevant, was outraged and admonished the attendant for his
attitude and or ignorance.  
The rows adding up to apparently 100 or more seats were so close one behind
the other that I could not imagine most of the lifejackets being got out at
all, and certainly not by the passengers in the seats under which the jackets
were. As I recall, there were four seats side-by-side on one side of a single
aisle and three on the other. I and the young, male attendant succeeded, I
suspect, mostly because we were kneeling, or close to it, in the aisle and
pulling the jackets into the aisle. It would have been reassuring if more of
the jackets had been without plastic wrapping and perhaps a little soiled from
study of them and emergency drills. It has even occurred to me that perhaps
the racks holding the jackets were built for the jackets depicted on the
walls, which looked much less bulky. Could the latter even have been
inflatable? The words of instruction with the pictures were in Vietnamese, so
I cannot be sure, though I did not notice anything in the text to indicate
inflatability, using my not inconsiderable portion of Vietnamese.  
Our trip had been judiciously delayed for a day, by the operators of the boat
(and of other boats, no doubt), until the swell between Ha Tien and Phu Quoc
had settled. The trip was smooth and the boat seemed to be navigated well. I
would say the farewell smile as we left the boat was due to this. What is of
concern â€“ to put it mildly â€“ is questions of emergency. I am inclined to
think of the charms put on the fronts of and dashboards of minibuses in
Vietnam. If you think something bad might happen, it may, the Vietnamese often
think, in my experience, after living in Vietnam for more than a decade.
Havenâ€™t enough prayers been said, in effect, for an accident not to happen?
Or, why do you travel if you think there could be an accident? One of my
strongest memories is of being accused, up country, of causing a bus crash
because I predicted it (on the basis that it was clear the driver was going
too fast).  
And, in this story, made more sad by the  
recollection of a more recent drowning of people attending a childâ€™s
birthday party on a cruise boat no further afield than on the Saigon River, we
bought tickets for our return on an amazingly fast, 35 minutes to Saigon, very
effectively styled, Bombardier aircraft flown by Air Mekong. You can add,
roughly speaking, another 35, the number of US dollars per ticket, though
perhaps prices vary. And they threw in French pastries of various kinds, a
kind of lottery in flight in which you compared what you got with what she
got, etc. This was fun and they were trying; potential customers around this
country need to be aware that their decisions determine whether such exciting
and inexpensive services as Air Mekong thrive.  
It was a sign of our experience on the Hong Tam 2 that we asked in the little
booking office on Phu Quoc whether the Bombardier would be flown by a
foreigner pilot. We were delighted when the young woman replied fast and
perfectly unabashed: all their pilots were foreigners. None of us was being
politically incorrect and questioning whether Vietnamese pilots were good at
flying planes or good at checking out safety. I said at the time, â€˜A foreign
pilot would not take off unless all safety measures were in place.â€™ And
neither, I say now, would a Vietnamese one. What I am saying is that perhaps
our Hong Tam 2 experience touched us deeply. Something so deep could be
spiritual. It may be something that is well known to the Vietnamese themselves
and not, usually, to people from other cultures. If, on arriving at a birthday
party, or on a commuter boat, or even an airliner, a salt-of-the-earth
Vietnamese is shown the lifeboats, lifejackets or emergency doors, what does
he or she think â€“ but disaster? How, on one hand, can you put faith in
Buddhist gods and on the other do emergency drills with passengers? Isnâ€™t
there a spiritual conflict here and may it not have an effect on accidents and
accident statistics ?

People who admire the heroism of the British divers that risked their lives to
rescue the young Thai boys from Tham Luang Cave will get the chance to follow
another mission by the same heroes in Vietnam.  
The famed divers Richard Stanton, John Volanthen, Jason Mallison and Chris
Jewell are diving inside Son Doong Cave in Quang Binh Province to explore a
mysterious passage found at the end of the cave.  
In June last year, twelve young boys, members of the youth football team Wild
Boars, together with their coach, entered Tham Luang cave network in Chiang
Rai, Thailand and were trapped by rising flood water.  
Richard Stanton and John Volanthen were the first divers who found the boys
alive in July, a miraculous rescue mission in an extremely dangerous
situation.  
In Vietnam, the four dived to explore a passage connecting this cave with
another cave nearby.  
The four worked with caving expert, Martin Holroyd, who works as a safety
guide in tour expeditions run by Oxalis Adventure Tours, the sole tour
provider into Son Doong. Cavers from the British Cave Research Association
suspected that Thung Cave, a grotto 600m from the end of Son Doong, connects
Son Doong through the passage. Thung Cave, explored in 1994, is 3.3km long and
it has a large river running inside, just like Son Doong.  
In 2010, during the thorough survey conducted by members of the British
association, the cavers found out that water from the river running inside Son
Doong goes through a gate at the end of the giant cave.  
At that time, the British caving team believed Son Doong and Thung caves
connected through the passage, as the river inside Son Doong was found coming
in a straight line from the end of Thung.  
According to Howard Limbert, who was a member of the 2010 team and is caving
technical director of Oxalis, it took the team members eight years to identify
where the current inside the passage led and they finally decided diving into
the passage would be the only way to have the answer.  
Limbert estimated the diving mission would be tough, as a large water volume
from the Son Doong River pouring into the passage would make the current
extremely strong.  
Oxalis worked with the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park to organise the mission
and the company sponsored US$53,000 for all the mission expenses. Oxalis
described the diving missionâ€™s members as the best divers in the world but
Limbert cautioned that the job would be extremely risky.  
The mission commenced on April 1, when the experts believed that the Son Doong
River was in ideal conditions for diving. Water level inside the passage in
April was 40m deep. Oxalisâ€™ boss Nguyen Chau A said he expected the passage
would prove to be the connector between Son Doong and Thung caves. If the two
caves were one, Son Doongâ€™s overall volume would be over 40.4 million cubic
metres. The â€˜expandedâ€™ Son Doong would be bigger in volume compared to the
Clearwater Cave.  
Clearwater Cave is part of the Grunung Mulu National Park, which is located in
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Clearwater is 39.5 million cubic metres in volume.
Son Doong is 9km or 5.6 miles long, and with the 67.2m passage, the caveâ€™s
overall volume is 38.8 million cubic metres. Thung Cave is 3.3km or 2 miles
and with a 22m estimated passage, it has overall volume of 1.6 million cubic
metres. Prior to the April mission, the duration of the task had not been
known Oxalis also organised a task force, including porters and supporters
familiar with caving inside Son Doong as well as trekking in the forest. The
team members were trained by experts from the British association and have
worked in the job for over a decade.  
They carry oxygen tanks, compressors, and camping equipment as well as
supporting the mission team members until reaching the passageâ€™s entrance.  
Oxalis had strict guidelines to ensure the ecosystem inside the cave would be
well-protected, but they welcomed partners eligible for documenting and
reporting the incredible mission.  
Oxalis also expected the missionâ€™s outcomes would contribute positively to
science and the study of karst caves. According to the company, the national
flag carrier Vietnam Airlines offered the four British divers free flights to
Quang Binh Province, where Son Doong is located.  
Members of British Cave Research Association have spent almost 30 years
exploring caves in the province. They discovered more than 300 dry caves and
caves with subterranean rivers. This was the first time the British cavers and
divers exploring an underground watery passage.  
Over three decades, the British cavers surveyed and announced systems of karst
caves in Quang Binh. The Phong Nha system includes Son Doong, Thung, Phong
Nha, Va, and Nuoc Nut caves. The Vom system comprises the caves of Vom and
Thien Duong (Paradise). The Nuoc Mooc has caves with water pouring into Mooc
stream. The Tu Lan system has Tu Lan, a group of caves and Tien Cave.  
Remarkably, the British cavers paid all related expense for the 30-year survey
by themselves. Howard Limbert and his partners consider Quang Binh, Vietnam
their second home and they have contributed much for Oxalis to exploit Son
Doong, Tu Lan and other caves for tourism in a sustainable and eco-friendly
way.
