 **Vietnam Heritage has been publishing a series based on Vietnamese Ancient
Jade, published in Hanoi, 2011, by Vietnam National Museum of History. This
month the topic is censers used by the Nguyen Dynasty.  
**  
Jade objects had many uses in past times; decorations for the Royal office,
pots and vases for domestic functions and censers for  
religious ceremonies. Generally, censers were made only from spinach-green and
white jades.  
Jade censers were different than the well-known bronze censer, which only
featured a vessel and a lid. Spinach-green jade censers usually had three
‘feet’ on their rounded bottoms.  
The decorative subjects of spinach-green jade censers were recurring motifs
from the Chinese Shang Dynasty. Censer feet were often carved to resemble
animal feet. Censers might also depict tiger faces, birds, a dragon’s or
elephant’s head on the handles. Besides tiger faces, there was the lotus
petal, a recurring S character, and lotus string motifs.  
The white jade censer had four flat round feet; its top was decorated with
five roll claws and four rolling dragons in the corners. Two faces of the
censer were carved into the shape of a book and decorated with the Chinese
character ‘Hy’ (Be glad).  
Based on the five dragons with whirl tails and rolling dragon motifs on some
jade censers, we think that they are from the 19th century Hue Imperial Royal
collection. They are of the highest quality and typical of Nguyen’s art.  
Some grey-white jade incense burners, pots and vases have a colour, material
and animal motifs similar to glazed ceramic pots from Emperor Gia Long’s reign
(1762-1820).  
Round incense burners with four animal feet and decorated with four elephant
heads in a circle were often carved with recurring S characters and cloud
motifs.

Peddlers in Saigon, around 1930.

It is hard to imagine Ho Chi Minh City without the motorbikes and throngs of
people. But if your mind’s eye is not quite up to the job, then there is a
wonderful compact coffee table book of picture postcards to whisk you back to
the calmer days of yesteryear. Over the ten years he has been coming to
Vietnam, M. Philippe Chaplain has assembled a remarkable collection of images
that not only show you how familiar landmark buildings and places used to
look, but also documents the daily ways of life of ordinary people in the city
once known as Saigon that have long since gone.  
The book, with text in English and French, is entitled ‘Saigon: Pearl of the
Far East, La Perle D’Extreme Orient’. It is divided into six sections:
Architecture, Ceremony, Daily Life, Theatre, Transport, and Women. I refer to
this book as ‘coffee table’ in the best sense of the phrase, as the pictures
are accompanied by informative and well-written commentary. This is a tome to
be shared, as there is much to stimulate conversation. My English conversation
class of mature students found it gave them much about which to reminisce.

Despite the wrecking-ball havoc that Saigon has undergone in recent years,
there remains plenty of old buildings to appreciate. Some, however, can only
have their memory preserved in pictures such as these. Even some of the
survivors show a marked difference in character or exist in a different
architectural context than before. The Ben Thanh market in a brownish image
with horses and carts in front of it seems a ghost of its present self.
Another picture shows the first Saigon Railway station with a train in the
square opposite this iconic market, where now there stands a bus terminal. The
present-day station is depicted when it was new; a mud road with only four
people in front of it.  
The Buddhist monks and priests in the ‘Ceremony’ section look more ascetic and
serious than those of our time. Were it not for the robes of the participants
the Cho Lon dragon procession and rich man’s funeral, however, things have not
changed that much. Also included are a row of scholars in their academic
gowns, who look as if they have stepped out of the Temple of Literature and a
charming shot of a young lady serving tea to her elderly mother.  
As one looks at the people caught by the camera in just an instant as they
were going about their daily business, the realization of the fleeting nature
of life is rammed home. All of these folk, even the baby with the cowboy hat
in his wicker chair and the little children collecting water and at their
sewing work, have long since now passed on. We see how the clothes people wore
were different then. Globalisation, in this respect, has not bypassed Vietnam.
Yet the essence of human life has changed little as we see the forebears in
outdoor markets, working as street vendors and a family gathered together at
dinner around the rice bowl on a long wooden table. Strange to think I might
be that every day passing by in Saigon’s streets the great children of these
ghosts captured on film. Rural life, too, remains the same, though maybe not
for much longer will we be taking snaps of bullocks ploughing the rice and
farmers straining their backs to plant it.  
A flick of the page and it is back in time on a trip to the theatre of days
past, which, of course, assumed greater importance in times of limited
entertainment choices. There is a memorable view of the sprawling Annamite
Theatre at Cho Lon, with its tower and turrets, which recall Shakespeare’s
‘Globe’. Its richly clothed actresses are separately featured. Then, as you
can now see in top hotel lobbies, there are views of musicians in traditional
garb playing iconic Vietnamese instruments. There is also a great shot of a
children’s orchestra assembled in someone’s back yard. Eerily devoid of people
and traffic, we are treated to a Lam Son square with green swards, park
benches and trees between its Opera House and The Grand Hotel.  
Moving on to ‘Transport’, the barges on the Saigon River look much the same.
There are scenes of near empty streets with the first motorised vehicles and
outside of the Ben Thanh market, where you now would be lucky to see the fast-
disappearing cyclo, there is a line of hand-pulled rickshaws awaiting
customers. Old postal buses, packet boats at dock, a passenger liner with
French gentlemen in white suits and pith helmets out to greet arrivals, an old
Air France poster and a view of Charnier Street (Le Loi) with 1950s French
Renault and 2 CV cars, complete this section.  
Finally, M. Chaplain includes some portraits of Vietnamese, their grace and
charm showing in even the most mundane of activities. We can see women-from
the high class to street vendor. They are enjoying a meal together, playing
cards, celebrating Tet, out in the street, holding the baby and posing for the
camera individually in their finery. We can see that the ‘ao yai’ and the
‘yem’, now only seen at special times or on schoolgirls, were standard wear in
the past.  
This hard paperback tome packs a lot into its 117 pages, with a little list at
the back of place names now and their equivalents in the time of the French.
Then, as now, it seems there was never a dull moment in Saigon and plenty of
interesting subjects for the photographer to snap and show the folks back
home. Here, then, is a book to remind us that ‘the past is a foreign country,
they do things differently there’* True, but not so differently as these old
postcards show us that fundamentally today’s Saigoners still have the same
day-to-day tasks, challenges and pleasures in life as did their ancestors.

A single-wheeled handcart, near Hanoi, 1908

collector Philippe Chaplain

 **The long, slow journey of the push cart**

  
Prior to the twentieth-century, the means for conveying goods among the
Vietnamese were quite primitive and belonged to the sorts of those societies
most underdeveloped in the world at that time. In order to transport many
things or those that were heavy, the sole form of transport was by boat.
Indeed, the principle conveyance for construction rock along with major stones
was for people to use rollers to carry them onto rafts and then take them to
their destination via waterways. Trade on the waters by riverboat became a
professional activity because so many rivers and streams crisscrossed the
country and, from the rivers, people could make it to remote locations.  
Transport over land by buffalo cart, oxcart, and horse cart was actually not
that prevalent, since buffaloes and oxen were rather costly. Hence, shoulder
poles and carrying goods on the head were a characteristic way of life.
Vietnamese farmers could shoulder quite a load; thirty to forty kilograms was
normal, while the heftier bore fifty to seventy. Shouldering water, paddy,
firewood, and goods was an everyday activity, so nearly everyone could do it.  
One of the most common transport means used was the single-wheeled handcart.
It was the most ancient vehicle in the Orient; perhaps over two thousand years
of age. They were quite primitive and included two long shafts attached at the
front to a wheel made from the slice of a wooden log. The two shafts extended
to the rear so that a person could hold them with both hands and push the cart
forward. Goods were laden atop the two cart shafts.  
Thus was the simplistic design of the pushcart, although, in the process of
transporting goods along with people, it had been improved several times. With
horse carts, the solid wheel was quite heavy and generated a great deal of
friction, so the speed was not very high. Hence, people improved upon it by
switching to a hollow wheel that included a circular rim and a central axle
connected by spokes. Pushcarts, too, were thus improved. Nevertheless, in
ancient Vietnamese villages, just making the spokes was rather difficult, so
they used solid wheels all the way up until the twentieth century.  
As the iron and steel industry developed, pushcarts made from iron also became
prevalent on construction sites. The two shafts were attached to a barrow. At
the head of the shafts was an iron wheel with spokes and a lubricated axle.
Yet, this cart still screeched whenever the wheels turned, so it was chiefly
referred to as the ‘squeaky-wheeled cart’ (xe cut kit).  
In the book ‘Le Tonkin en 1900’ by R. Rubio (Paris, 1900), there are some
photographs of Northern peasants transporting goods with the single-wheeled
hand barrow. People set a bamboo floorboard on the two shafts so that the cart
could be laden with a lot of goods, even two large barrels. Beneath the
shafts, near the person pushing them, were two supporting legs. When at rest,
the legs held the cart in place while keeping it standing. This hand barrow
was also illustrated in the technology books of the Annamese and Henri Oger.
The Chinese people, in their utilization of pushcarts, made an ingenious
innovation. They affixed a pole and sail to the cart; if they went in the
direction of the wind, the sail facilitated pushing the cart further and
faster.  
Many products such as the water-wheel, water mill, wheel, and turntable, are
essentially considered the discoveries of agricultural societies.
Nevertheless, whether imported from abroad or invented domestically, these
products were seldom innovated and were applied multifariously, especially in
the olden village communities of an agricultural form, where they endured for
a long time.  
The wooden solid-wheeled pushcart was a characteristic Vietnamese-fashioned
product; despite humanity’s having switched to the spoked wheel all the way
back in ancient Greece during the fifth to fourth centuries prior to the
common era. Perhaps it retained the original features from the time when
people [first] thought up this kind of cart all the way up until the
nineteenth-century. Even after this cart disappeared from conventional farming
life, its form remained unchanged.  
The ball-bearing wheelbarrow was a second kind of product, which was a type of
double-shafted handcart for either pushing or pulling. Later on, this handcart
became prevalent in rustic villages during the war and was called the
‘innovated cart’ (xe cai tien). At first, it was just like the buffalo and
horse carts, except that it was not pulled by domestic animals, but humans.  
The business of running handcarts to pick up and drop off customers developed
in Hanoi and Saigon during the French colonial period. In fact, it also
developed throughout Asia, including China and India. Western gentlemen and
dames as well as wealthy, important officials rented litters to travel in the
mountains and forests, while they rented hand-pulled rickshaws in the cities —
a story reflected in the writer Nguyen Cong Hoan’s ‘Horsemen and human horses’
(Nguoi ngua, ngua nguoi)*. As late as the 1970s, many labourers in Hanoi still
employed themselves to pull handcarts for delivering goods. These hand-pulled
carts were called ‘loading tricycles’ (xe ba gac). As for the hand-pulled
rickshaws, they came to an end by the 1950s and were replaced by bicycle
propelled rickshaws.  
In the rural villages, the ‘loading tricycle’ was an important means of
conveyance for firewood, paddy, straw, and even people who needed to go to the
hospital. Later on, because the wooden wheels were too weighty and made
getting around difficult, people improved upon it by installing gas tires and
streamlining the vehicle. Women, too, could pull them, as they did during the
war whilst the men all went into battle.  
 _*‘Human horses’ was a derogatory term for rickshaw pullers and drivers

Ho Chi Minh Museum is a memorial-type museum, a part of the Historic-Cultural
Legacy Complex which includes Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, Ho Chi Minh’s Living
Quarters and Ho Chi Minh Museum. The museum was opened on May 19th, 1990, the
100th Anniversary of the birth of Ho Chi Minh.  
The museum building is shaped like a 20 m tall white lotus. The exhibition
space is 4,000 m2, showcasing over 2,000 documents and artefacts (from nearly
17,000 items stored in the museum’s basic collection) that introduce the life
and legacy of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in connection with Vietnam’s and the
world’s history. There is also 600 m2 for topical exhibitions and cultural
activities. The museum’s library has over 8,000 titles, its archive – about 35
documents for Ho Chi Minh-related research. The Exploration and Experience
Space of the museum is an area of 150 m2.  
Every year, Ho Chi Minh Museum receives over a million visitors, among whom
more than 1/5 are foreigners.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/2648b.jpg)

To celebrate the 125th Anniversary of our National hero and World cultural
icon Ho Chi Minh (May 19, 1890 – May 19, 2015), Ho Chi Minh Museum will
initiate the following activities:

1\. Opening of the ‘Noble yet modest role models’ exhibition, which honours
125 of the most outstanding persons from all occupations and areas, who
learned and followed Ho Chi Minh’s moral example. The exhibition will open at
9 a.m., May 15, 2015 and lasts till the end of July, 2015.

2\. Opening of ‘Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the inspirer of creativity’ exhibition,
which introduces 79 artefacts and documents corresponding to the 79 years of
Chairman Ho Chi Minh’s life. These are gifts-some of which are being shown for
the first time to the public-from our people and from international friends of
Chairman Minh during his life. The exhibition will be open at Ho Chi Minh
Museum from May 18, 2015 to June 10, 2015.

3\. Educational activities for children from the 15th to the 20th of May on
the premises of the Museum. The kids will have memorable experiences by
viewing pictures from the patriotic movement initiated by Uncle Ho; learning
about exemplary kids from that movement who received a badge from Uncle Ho;
competing in telling stories and singing songs about Uncle Ho; recycling
products; making and wearing rubber sandals and many other games.

4\. Conference titled ‘Some solutions to attract visitors to museums and
memorials dedicated to Chairman Ho Chi Minh’ on 27-29th of May, 2015 in Tra
Vinh city, in cooperation with the local Dept. of Culture, Sports and Tourism.
This is a chance for the Network of Ho chi Minh Museums and Memorials to
clarify information related to Chairman Ho Chi Minh’s life and legacy, and to
try and find ways to attract tourists to visit the Museums and Memorials.

5\. The Ho Chi Minh Museum has been constructing a special exhibit ‘Space
where Uncle Ho wrote his last Will’ to open to the public on this occasion.
This additional exhibition space revives the years Chairman Ho Chi Minh
contemplated his historical ‘Will’, which is now one of the 30 National
Treasures that the Prime Minister had decreed to recognize in 2012.

**Incense smoke is always floating in Nguyen Cong Tru Temple at Quang Thien
Commune (Kim Son, Ninh Binh Province). Generations of descendants never forget
the deeds of the ancestor who pushed back the sea for new settlements.
Especially, at a time when China is trying to assert its possession of the
East Sea, Nguyen Cong Tru’s legacy is increasingly instilling in today’s
generation the sense of honor, patriotism and determination needed to defend
the heritage built by their ancestors.  
**

Tien Hai District of Thai Binh and Kim Son District of Ninh Binh are the land
that 200 years ago Nguyen Cong Tru, with his impoverished followers, expanded
toward the sea for new settlements. With the same spirit, many seashore
communities continue expanding the land seaward.  
Mr Nguyen Quang Dao, an elderly neighbor of the temple, said, the area was
notorious with devastating tidal waves. But Nguyen Cong Tru and his people
were relentless. The swampy, marshy land didn’t yield to people’s moving and
dyke-building, but neither did the people give up. A genius organizer and
leader, with 63 recruiters and 12,000 pairs of strong hands. Nguyen Cong Tru
accomplished building the Kim Son sea dyke in just over a year, and in the
10th year of Minh Mang reign, Kim Son district was officially established.  
Nguyen Cong Tru was an outstanding planner and builder of irrigation systems.
First, he connected An River with Can River to get fresh water. Then, to every
big village or two small ones, he built roads and dug canals to flush future
floods and wash the unbalanced ph, and to optimize land use for paddies. The
roads and the canals were built at the same time. Boundaries were defined for
every new settlement. Dwelling and paddy areas were separated. The life of new
settlers quickly stabilized. And so, only a few years after Nguyen Cong Tru
brought his people here, Kim Son became a prosperous area with fertile land,
advanced irrigation and healthy people.  
Nguyen Binh, a newsman who came with me to Nguyen Cong Tru Temple said,
‘Nguyen Cong Tru was so wise to have advised the Nguyen court to name the two
new districts Kim Son (Gold Mountain) and Tien Hai (Silver Sea). The depth of
our ancestors’ patriotism was infinite.’  
As the birthplace of the Vietnamese petrol and gas industry, Tien Hai today is
a golden land, spearheading the economy of Thai Binh Province.

_Kim Son currently has 27 communes, sharing an area of 213 km2. From the
12,000 pioneers, its population today has grown to over 200,000 people. At the
same time, Tien Hai has a town and 34 communes on an area of 226 km2, and a
population of 203,000 people.  
200 years from the time Nguyen Cong Tru came here to make new land and settle,
the Kim Son people have expanded their dykes 7 more times, pushed back the sea
and made their land longer and wider._

Right after its opening for visitors in early 2009, the Coi Nguon Museum on
Phu Quoc Island many call the ‘Jewel’ attracted curiosity and the attention of
historians and culturologists as well as tourists from all over the world.  
Visiting the museum, many are astonished to see so many over 2,000-year-old
relics left by those who inhabited this 600km2 island, which is 50km from the
mainland.  
Its website says that the museum has seven collections, most notably the one
with 2,645 stone, ceramic, porcelain, bronze and fossilized wooden items dated
from 15th to early 20th centuries, according to the Vietnam Relics
Preservation Centre of UNESCO.  
The next most remarkable one has hundreds of items related to traditional
trades of Phu Quoc Island, such as stilted houses, household utensils, tools
for fish sauce making, seafood harvesting and pepper cultivating.  
One of the rarest relics is the fossilized moss from the ‘Phu Quoc Sea and
Forest’ collection which contains sea bull bones, whale bones, wild boar
tusks, shells and corals.  
All the collections are stored in a five-storey building on a high ground, the
top of which opens the whole panoramic view of Phu Quoc town, sea and forests.  
In the 1.5ha premises of the museum, many of the rarest and most iconic
animals of Phu Quoc such as sea eagles, falcons and especially cow-licked dogs
are conserved and nourished.  
The impressive museum building that houses thousands of valuable items inside
may make one think that its owner is a rich man or a lucky heir. In fact, the
owner of this invaluable property, named Huynh Phuoc Hue, used to be a poor
student, considered by many as an ‘idiot’.  
Mr Hue was born in 1973 at Phu Quoc. After high school, he attended BA courses
in Saigon. When asked by friends about his homeland Phu Quoc, he often didn’t
know what to say. Embarrassed, he began collecting information and materials
about Phu Quoc.  
Meticulously copying news pieces, book chapters, research and journal
articles, Hue has acquired an ‘asset’ of 300 pieces of material about Phu Quoc
in Vietnamese, Chinese, English and French. He combined and edited these
materials, adding his own firsthand experiences and in 1997, finished his book
‘Phu Quoc’s potentials, the past and the present’.  
After the book became a tourist guidebook to Phu Quoc, Mr Hue applied for a
guide job at a tourist company. The job took him to all the nooks and crannies
of the island. He finds his homeland even richer and more beautiful than
whatever written and known until now.  
Taking guests around the island, he picked up and brought home sea shells that
caught his eyes. One day he came up with an idea of opening a gallery to
exhibit what he had collected. He went on collecting everything he thought
beautiful or precious. ‘Seeing me collecting things that nobody cared about,
many called me an idiot,’ Mr Hue recalls.  
Hue spent his spare time to turn his pieces of sea shells, pebbles and wood
into cute little souvenirs.  
And so, on a beautiful day after his wedding, the islanders dropped their jaws
seeing that the ‘idiot’ spent VND30 million he got as wedding present to open
the Coi Nguon Gallery to exhibit his ‘rubbish’ and the little things he made.  
As his items sold well, especially the aged ones, Mr. Hue turned passionate
about collecting antiques. Hearing any rumour of someone having found a broken
piece of pottery or a stone axe, he would go find the person and buy the piece
at any price. After five years of tireless and passionate work, he has amassed
a collection of thousands of items.  
In 2006, Dr Dang Van Bai (then head of the Department of Cultural Heritage of
the Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism) happened to drop by his gallery.
The collections here surprised Mr Bai, and he suggested Mr Hue to establish a
museum to preserve and promote the valuable heritage of Phu Quoc.  
He spent the next three years completing and documenting the relics and
classifying his collection into topical ones. In 2009, the Coi Nguon Museum,
one of 9 private museums at the time, was opened.

The era of Middle Prosperity of Le boasted having the most bizarre king in our
history, King Le Than Tong. He was born in 1607, in the two-century-long
period of power sharing between the Le and Trinh families. The Trinh Lords had
the real power, while Le Kings were only their marionettes. The Trinh Lords
decided who among the Le family would be the King. Somehow, as a 13-year-old
boy, Le Than Tong became king. Furthermore, the Trinh Lord forced him to marry
his (Trinh’s) daughter Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc as his Queen, who was 12 years
older than the king and had already four children. The king could but obey.
Having denounced burdens of kingship to be secluded royalty, he was enthroned
again against his will. In our history, perhaps Le Than Tong was the only
person to be king, unwillingly, and even twice at that.  
Being “intelligent and erudite, cunning, resourceful and versed in literary,
as a good king should be,” as described in historical records, the King
nevertheless submitted to the control of the Trinh clan, as he possessed no
real power. The courtiers advised against his marriage with too old a wife,
but he just clucked his tongue, “Just wanna be done with it.” His tongue
clucking gave him the peace of a caged bird. Not that he never wanted to seize
the power of the king, but quickly deferred every time because Lord Trinh Tung
was his grandfather on his mother’s side, and his son Lord Trinh Trang was his
uncle.  
The tangled blood relationships between the King’s clan and the Lords clan
helped reinforce the top echelon of power and keep the society stable. For 200
years of the Le-Trinh rule, the Northern border was kept firm, although the
Ming Dynasty was at its utmost prosperity and always covetous of Dai Viet.  
Le Than Tong only wanted that “the King’s and the Lord’s clans live in
harmony, peacefully enjoying heaven’s rewards. That’s the best state of the
union. Four times going out to wars, and two times ascending to the throne, is
it not remarkable?” commented historian Ngo Si Lien in his “History of Dai
Viet.”)  
Historians will long debate whether he was wise or weak. The fact is that the
Trinh Lords made him king, and then made four of his sons the successive
kings. So he also holds the record of fathering more kings than any others in
our country’s history.  
The king promoted talent, and removed the exam cheaters. According to the
records, in the 1623 doctorate exam a man named Nguyen Trat won the honor. But
as it was found out that he hired a proxy to earn his previous degree, the
king withheld the man’s doctorate degree and the accompanying mandarin
position. The 1628 exam yielded several doctors, including Giang Van Minh,
later a fabled diplomat. In the 1631 exam, it was reported that candidate
Nguyen Van Quang was matriculated below the standard grade, and the king
crossed out his name. Doctorate exams were held successfully in 1634, 1637 and
1643 in the same fashion. The talent selection exams under King Le Than Tong
were more fair than under many other rulers.  
Le Than Tong liked having foreign wives. He had Thai, Chinese, Laos and Muong
ones… Notably, he had also a Dutch wife named Orona. That helped the trade
with the Dutch flourish. In this period, many Dutch trading ships came to do
business in the North. Famous centers such as Pho Hien, Thang Long etc. were
bustling with trade, making Dai Viet rich and strong. Whether a political and
economic union or just another “tongue clucking” of the King, Queen Orona’s
importance was confirmed by the fact that she is one of the six queens and
concubines worshipped at Mat Temple in Thanh Hoa.  
It is worth mentioning the king’s first queen, Lady Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc. Being
the mother of the nation, she had not much of a happy marriage with the king
and soon retired to be a Buddhist nun at But Thap Pagoda in Bac Ninh. She
authored the “Explanation of Precious Sounds of the Southernmost Land,”
considered a Chinese-Vietnamese dictionary and the country’s first
encyclopedia.  
Le Than Tong favored Buddhism and loved to travel. The “Unified History of Dai
Nam” recorded, “King Le Than Tong traveled to Mount Gem Woman at Mat Son
Village, Bo Ve Commune, Dong Son District, and ordered the building of Dai Bi
Pagoda, also called Mat Son Pagoda, facing Vi Canal. The king also ordered the
carving of his statue, which is worshipped by locals till today.”  
Besides the statue of King Than Tong, Mat Son Pagoda also houses statues of
six of his wives seated around him. The statues are nearly life-sized, made of
precious timber, lacquered and gilded. Notably, the statue of Queen Orona has
typical Western features such as high and straight nose, opulent face,
splendid garments and portly figure. The presence of the Dutch Queen proves
that she had truly blended with the Vietnamese and they respected her despite
the fact that she was foreign. The King is seated on a triple lotus estrade.
His wives are in meditating positions, their hands making mudras. These
statues show how Queens and concubines dressed in Le’s court. Queen Trinh Thi
Ngoc Truc’s statue, the most beautiful one, was taken away to be placed in the
National Museum of Arts and recently ranked a National Treasure.  
After abdicating in favor of his son Le Chan Tong, Le Than Tong receded to
live in Khan Son Pagoda in the northwest of Thang Long Citadel. Buddhism was
prominent, and Buddhist temples sprang up everywhere.  
As Le Hy Tong, Le Than Tong’s youngest son ascended to the throne,
Confucianism usurped the dominance over Buddhism and monks were persecuted and
had to flee from Thang Long or be decapitated. It was His Reverence Tong Zien,
the Second Progenitor of the sect of Tao Dong, who wrote a petition letter to
disabuse King Le Hy Tong and restore him to the righteous way. To show his
repentance before the Buddha, Le Hy Tong had a statue made of himself kneeling
on all fours, with Buddha sitting on his back. This most unique statue is very
well preserved and worshipped in the pagoda of Hoe Nhai.

The opening of the exhibition titled “Ocean’s secrets from ancient wrecks” was
held at the National Museum of History no. 1 Trang Tien Street, Hanoi on
January 18, 2019  
In an area of about 600m2, the exhibition “Ocean’s secrets from ancient
wrecks” introduces to the public about 500 works dated from the 13th to the
18th centuries, selected from the Museum’s treasure trove of Vietnamese, Thai
and Chinese ceramic and porcelain relics, belonging to 4 main topics:
Vietnamese maritime trade; Vietnamese commercial ceramics; Maritime Silk Road;
and Wrecks excavated from Vietnamese sea bed.  
These antique relics have been exhibited under the title “Ceramics and china
found in Vietnam Seas” by the National Museum of History together with the
National Research Institute of Maritime Cultural Heritage of Korea in Mokpo
and Busan from Nov. 2017 to Apr. 2018, and have been met by the Korean
research community and public with keen interest.  
These relics, which were goods carried by ancient merchant ships and found on
the floor of the Eastern Sea of Vietnam, prove the important role of Vietnam
in international trade in the golden age of the maritime Silk Road. Moreover,
with the ceramic production center of Chu Dau, Vietnam actively participated
in producing, importing and exporting goods with many countries in the world
during the 15th-16th centuries. Some restored items of the Chu Dau Ceramic
Joint Stock Company are also featured at the exhibition to promote the
restoration and development of a unique traditional strain of ceramics of
Vietnam.  
Remarkably, this is the first time the National Museum of History has
introduceds the public to the fullest, most extensive amount of ceramic and
china artifacts recovered from the wrecks found in Binh Chau, Binh Thuan, Hon
Zam, Cu Lao Cham, Hon Cau and Ca Mau – the six ancient ships that the National
Museum of History took part in excavating. The excavation of these ships have
brought the museum invaluable artifacts and documents, a new perception of the
science of archeology and have proven the importance and strategic position of
Vietnamese seas in international trade.  
In his opening speech, Dr. Nguyen Van Cuong emphasized, “Organizing this
exhibition we defined its significance and content in such a way best fitted
to promote the history, the country and the people of Vietnam. It should be
stressed that Vietnam is a seafaring nation that has been present very early
on the biggest trade routes of the world. The selected artifacts should
present the process of formation and development of the maritime trade routes
in which Vietnam played an active role. At the same time, we want to highlight
the political aspects of Vietnam defending its sovereignty regarding the
Paracel and Spratly Islands which have always been operated and ruled by
Vietnam.”  
This exhibition will provide the domestic and international public with more
facts on the history of foreign trade of Vietnam in conjunction with its
maritime sovereignty and the maritime Silk Road. The exhibition will be open
for 4 months (Jan. 18 to May 18, 2019.)  
On this occasion the National Museum of History has arranged the reception of
the original artifacts, photos and documents related to the Paris Peace Accord
from former Vice President Ms. Nguyen Thi Binh; and of two Peugeot bicycles
from Mr. Dao Xuan Tinh, owner of the record collection of Peogeot bicycles
produced in the Republic of France, donated to the Museum.

Warehouse-keeper is boss of bosses. The reality in government owned businesses
was full of red tape that required many signatures and seals, and everybody
could exaggerate their role and unreasonably create problems for others. So
even with the boss’s approval if the warehouse-keeper refuses then nothing can
get done.

Book review by Thuy Lien ; Photos from the book “Th??ng nh? th?i bao c?p”

**Nostalgia of the Era of Subsidized Economy** is a collection of idioms,
proverbs, common sayings, rhyming verses and kiosk signs etc. which were so
familiar to everyone during that time. Taking inspiration from that unique
material, artists Thanh Phong and Com (Huu Khoa) have created illustrative
images that are, humorous, sarcastic, and at times painfully ironical.  
Each image illustrating such an idiom or proverb etc. by depicting a ration
coupon or a brick standing in queue is as effective as a panoramic picture of
a historical period full of hardship due to lack of basic necessities such as
a towel or a package of dried fish. But somehow, the two artists manage to
express the positive, optimistic mood of the era and the humorous critical
attitude of the people.  
The title “Nostalgia of the Era of Subsidized Economy” alone is representative
enough of the heartfelt endearment. Each page with a picture and just a few
words can fill the imagination with a flood of vivid and fresh stories and
images told by the elder generations.  
In a way, the current year in Hanoi can be seen as the year of nostalgia of
the era of subsidization. Many exhibitions, shops, restaurants etc. appear,
simulating the lifestyle of the era, melting the hearts of the middle aged
generation and provoking the curiosity and inquisitiveness of the young ones
growing up in the time of openness and integration.  
As a part of that trend, “Nostalgia of the era of subsidized economy” has its
own uniqueness. It not only recalls history but also conveys all the
bitterness, hardship and whimsicalities of an extraordinary historical period.  
Many of the idioms of that unique era are still very popular today such as
“placing a brick,”, “somebody’s son”, “eating before the signal”, etc. In the
time of ration coupons, basic necessity products were rarely available at the
shops, and every time there was an announcement that for example meat will be
sold the next day, people come to the shop at 2 or 3am and place a brick there
to represent them in a queue and then went home to resume their sleep. In the
morning, a queue was formed in front of the shop, sometimes hundreds of meters
long. Hence the expression “placing a brick.”  
Many corrupt and bad practices that occurred in the system of subsidization
still remain in our society like malignant tumors, such as embezzlement, red
tape, finger pointing etc.  
That’s why the proverbs and idioms that appeared during that time are still
applicable today. For example, “Work to empty your stomach, talk to fill it,”
or “Blessed be the crawling, death to the proud.” The meanings are quite
obvious. It is worth mentioning that these phenomena were very widespread,
making the hardship of life even more bitter and people’s spirit crisper.  
It’s not by chance that the era has again acquired such an appeal. Vietnam has
opened its doors to modernization for about 30 years. Many things have been
greatly improved, but some values, such as affection to one another among
people and strong will to overcome the odds and to preserve the good
traditions, have also been diminished, little by little.  
It’s good for modern Vietnamese and international friends to read, understand
and contemplate the “Nostalgia of the Era of Subsidized Economy.” It is not an
attempt to romanticize or to poeticize that era of difficulties, Instead it
inspires us to live well our present life and look positively toward the
future.

**“ When talking about the era of subsidized  
economy, don’t forget the positive values ”  
**

The era of subsidization, colloquially dubbed “the stand-in the queue” era
started in the North in 1957, and after April 1975, it spread all over the
country. It truly ceased to exist only after April 1989. During this period,
everything was planned and controlled by the government, a typical
characteristics of a communist economy, which doesn’t accept free enterprise.  
Today in Hanoi, among those hustling amidst the hectic life of bustling shops,
there are many people that belong to the old times, nostalgic souls tossing
and turning about the future. I had a chance to talk to a 87 year-old woman
visitor, Mrs Phuong at the launching of the book “Nostalgia of the era of
subsidization”.

**Hello Ms. Phuong. Please share with us more about your work in the
subsidized economy.  
** At first, I worked at the Paper Factory Hoang Van Thu (aka Dap Cau), built
by the French in Thai Nguyen Province. During the war of resistance against
the French, the factory was moved to the Safe Zone, and I worked mostly at Chu
market. Afterwards, I was assigned a job at the Ministry of Finance.  
 **  
When talking about that era, what comes to your mind first?  
** The era had many periods, such as the war of resistance period, the
nationalization period, the period of construction of socialism in the North,
and the period after the country’s reunification.  
There are so many memories. Take for example, water. I am the kind of person
who gets hot and was always anxiously waiting for the time water began running
to get into queue to have a shower to cool down.  
My husband and I were in the cadre receiving low ration coupons. Having 4 four
children, our income was not enough to survive and we had to grow chickens,
weave wool sweaters and so on to make more income. Everybody had to. I had
scratched hands from weaving, and my daughter had to weave with me. I often
got drowsy and they had to shake me and urge me to finish a sweater or a
shawl. When I gave birth to my first child, we didn’t have enough to eat. All
I was given was cane sugar treacle that we called war time chocolate.  
To me, the days at the Safe Zone were the most memorable. It was simply
hardship in all aspects of life. I dared but to dream to have a meal with
boiled morning glory and fish sauce. On my wedding at the base, we had but
fried peanuts to treat invited guests. We even had to borrow money from the
worker’s union. There was no camera to capture images of the wedding.  
Life was poor, but the discipline was high. People were united, unified, and
mutually reliable. Upper and lower cadres had common consent. Everything was
devoted to the country.  
Every time a female colleague gave birth to a child, everybody took turn to
help with washing and babysitting. That created beautiful bonds. We have gone
our separate ways afterwards but always remember, keep in touch with, and see
each other any time we can.  
 **  
What similarities and differences are there between the era of subsidized
economy and the era of renovation of the last 30 years, according to you?  
** Both eras have the principles of democracy and fairness, but nowadays they
are not followed as well as before. Today, a large part of young people don’t
pursue their education to the end, and theft and drug abuse have spread.
Perhaps it was hard in my time, but it was also much safer and more
disciplined. Today, you the young people have more opportunity to study and
better access to knowledge. You have better chances to improve yourselves and
contribute positively to society. However, the way I see it, family happiness
is not as well- appreciated and protected as it used to be in my time. That’s
so sad.  
Life is always hard, and the hardship of those times could make everyone feel
self-pity and indignity as they recall it. But somehow I cherish that era
because I had beautiful mementos, good friends and good supervisors. Everybody
lived a modest and simple life then. In hardship we learn how great human
endurance, perseverance and sacrifice can be. ­  
 **Thank you for the meaningful conversation. I wish you good health to enjoy
your life with your family and to witness the positive things to come in this
country.

Tai

In February 1943 at the Meeting of the standing committee of the Indochinese
Communist Party’s Central Committee, ‘Draft of the foundations of Vietnam’s
culture’ the party’s first political guidelines on culture written by the
General Secretary Truong Chinh was debated and passed. This is a historical
document that shows principles and directions for building a new culture – the
revolutionary culture.  
The draft highlights the Party’s standpoint and basic philosophy as related to
culture and arts. It puts forward three principles to build the new culture:
nationalist, popular and scientific. Culture is one of the three main
frontiers; the economy and politics being the other two. In parallel with
political revolution, cultural revolution must be conducted. Only being in
control of the cultural movements can the Party control the public opinion and
will the Party’s propaganda be effective.  
The Draft’s ideological content has correctly and timely reflected the demands
for building a revolutionary culture, and is the important guideline for
giving birth to new culture and arts of Vietnam.  
While the August Revolution was being celebrated, while a myriad of complex
things are to be built, while the new Republic immediately faces new perils in
the face of internal and foreign enemies, the Party and Uncle Ho went on
establishing a new government, which means not only developing the economy,
building democratic institutions, but also strengthening the foundations of
new culture based on traditional values of the people, in order to defend the
independence and affirm the power and the master status of the people.  
At the first National Cultural Congress that took place in Hanoi capital on
Nov 24, 1946, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, ‘Culture lights up our nation’s way’.
That shows that the Party and Uncle Ho highly appreciated the guiding role of
culture in the nation’s development and the revolution movement.  
Exhibition ‘Literature and art in the war of resistance (1945-1954)’ has
highlighted the Party’s and Chairman Ho Chi Minh’s policies and ideology on
cultural revolution.  
Almost 200 images, documents and artifacts from the collections of the
National Museum of History and Vietnam Literary Museum at the topical
exhibition ‘Literature and Arts in the war of resistance (1945-1954)’ are
showcased in 2 parts:

**Part 1, The Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture and the Party’s
policies regarding culture  
** ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture’ appeared at the time the
Vietnamese people endured the exploitation of both the French colonialists and
the Japanese fascists. They not only exploited us economically, but also
poisoned us culturally by deception, demagogy and fake democracy. In such
circumstances, Nguyen Ai Quoc came back to the country and decided to
establish Viet Minh Front. He wrote letters to the fellow countrymen and women
and published ‘Independent Vietnam’ newspaper to spread ideas, to lay bare the
enemies’ conspiracies and crimes, and to call the people to be united in Viet
Minh to fight away the French and the Japanese.  
In 1943, the Viet Minh movement grew quite strong in the countryside but
remained not so visible in the cities because it had not mobilized and
recruited the intellectuals, especially the writers and artists to the unified
national patriotic front. To fix that situation, the General Secretary Truong
Chinh had written the Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture and at Vong La
Commune, Dong Anh, Han?i, the Meeting of the standing committee of the Party’s
Central Committee that took place on Feb 25-28, 1943 passed it.  
The ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture’ printed in no. 1 of The
Avangard Journal, the New Culture propaganda organ of the Vietnam association
of patriotic culture experts, is currently kept at the National Museum of
History.  
As a coincidence, while the ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture’ was
being passed in 1943, Uncle Ho, who was in China, being kept a prisoner by
Chiang Kai-shek, took time to think about building a new national culture for
the future. The two events, though happening in different places and
circumstances, took place at the same time and serve the same purpose and
idea.  
Immediately after the publication of the ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s
culture,’ patriotic intellectuals started actively supporting, participating,
and initiating new culture – a revolutionary culture-building movement.  
Recognizing the utmost importance of Culture, just one day after the country
regained independence, on September 3, 1945 in the first meeting of the
cabinet, Chairman Ho Chi Minh highlighted the six most urgent tasks of the
Government, two of which were related to culture. First, illiteracy must be
eliminated together with famine. Two, the people’s moral must be re-educated.  
The Party’s important standpoints on culture, expressed in the ‘Draft of
foundations of Vietnam’s culture’ have been complemented and completed by the
demands in subsequent stages of revolution. And on each such stage, our Party
further improved its policies on culture and arts. The VIII National Congress
of the Party in 1996 has stressed: ‘All activities related to culture and arts
must serve the purpose of building and developing an advanced culture, rich in
national features, and creating a Vietnamese personality in the aspects of
ideology, moral, spirit, emotions, lifestyle and establishing a healthy
cultural environment for the development of the society.’  
At the 5th meeting of the Central Committee (VIII term) in 2014, this policy
was one step further improved to assert that ‘Culture is the foundation of the
society, at the same time the motif that accelerates socio-economic
development.’  
These reliefs were made by artist and stage and film director Phan Tai. In his
lifetime, he made hundreds of statues and reliefs that recorded the faces of
the top people in the literary and artistic world of Vietnam.  
The exhibition also quotes remarks and assessments of scholars, culture
experts, writers and artists on the ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s
culture’ that have been published in books, journals and some of the Party’s
documents related to culture, literature and arts.

**Part 2, Literature and arts in the war of resistance (1945-1954)  
** The ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture’ that was passed in 1943 has
widened the creative wingspan of writers and artists. Their profuse and
intelligent production always firmly anchored in their mission within the
revolutionary movement, reflects fully and truthfully the reality of the
people’s life and struggle, and encourage the people in a timely and effective
fashion as well as supporting the armed forces in fighting the war and
building a new life.  
In the letter to artists and painters on the occasion of the exhibition of
their works in December 1951, Chairman Ho Chi Minh stressed: ‘Culture and Arts
is also a front. You are the soldiers on that front.’  
This letter of His was later published in no. 1986, Jan 5, 1952 of ‘Nation’s
salvation’ newspaper, as the nation entered the all-out stage of resistance
war against the French colonialists.  
The Uncle’s teaching had greatly encouraged the writers and artists,
stimulating them to work diligently for our cause. The years 1945- 1954 had
given birth to a countless number of works of literature and art that served
the war so well.  
Among the works of this period there is a blood painting ‘Chairman Ho Chi Minh
and children from all over the country’ by artist Diep Minh Chau. On Sept 2,
1947 as the country celebrated 2nd anniversary of the country, the artist
attended a fair organized at Dong Thap Base listened again to Uncle Ho reading
the Declaration of Independence on the radio and a group of children singing
the song ‘Praising Chairman Ho’ by Luu Huu Phuoc. A powerful surge inside
overwhelmed him. Though having never met the Uncle, but led by emotion, he cut
his arm to get blood to paint a portrait of the Uncle with three kids
representing the North, Middle and South of Vietnam. The blood painting was
later sent to the Viet Bac base to be presented to Uncle Ho with a letter ‘To
the nation’s Father Ho Chi Minh’ from the young author.  
Regarding the blood painting of artist Diep Minh Chau, many have had a chance
to see it, but mostly in the printed form. Today, the painting is kept at the
National Museum of History. This is a silk painting, and painted with blood,
so as time has passed, it has been discolored. But it is a proof of the love
of the Vietnamese people toward Uncle Ho and their unshakable faith in his
cause.  
The statue ‘Uncle Ho’s Portrait’ was made by artist Nguyen Thi Kim, Vietnam’s
first artist sculptor. She had the honor to directly sculpt His statue.  
Every time we mention the name of composer Luu Huu Phuoc, many pieces of music
immediately come to our mind, such as Hit the road, Call to youth, Uncle’s
love shines over our lives, At 20 years, Out to the streets, Liberating the
South, Praising the liberation army, Liberation march, Marching to Saigon…  
He was one of the first Vietnamese composers to use the marching rhythms to
awaken and appeal to young generations to join the nation’s liberation cause.
Besides composing, he was also a political and social activist, and devout
music educator for the youth. For his great contributions in the history of
revolutionary music the Government had conferred upon him many medals and
decorations of the highest order, such as First rank Independence Medal and
the Ho Chi Minh Prize in Literature and Arts of first batch in 1996.  
Among the many songs written about Hanoi, The song ‘Marching on Hanoi’ by
composer Van Cao may be the most miraculous. It’s a miracle because it was
written five years before the day our army marched to free Hanoi. In October,
1954 Hanoi opened all its gates to received troops from Viet Bac Base, who
marched like sea waves that entered the city through all of its gates, exactly
the way it was described so beautifully by Van Cao in the song. From the day
it was written, the song, beloved by all, has become the triumphal song of the
coming home sons of Hanoi yesterday, today, and ever after.  
In the war of resistance against the French, propaganda paintings were sharp
weapons to educate, prepare, motivate and stimulate the masses. They also
helped convey the tasks to be done to serve the revolution, and lifted the
masses’ spirits so they would accomplish those tasks. The content of those
tasks has helped the genre of propaganda painting make big strides to
perfection.  
For the great contributions of writers and artists to the cause of revolution
and in rebuilding and developing the country, since 1996 the Government has
conferred Ho Chi Minh Prize – the highest prize for the authors of the best
works of literature and arts. This prize is considered the highest honor a
cultural worker can achieve. The Ho Chi Minh Prize is announced every five
years on Independence Day (September 2).  
Government literary and artistic prizes are handed to authors in the fields of
music, literature, fine art, photo art, dance, cinematography, folk art and
architecture. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism establishes and
chairs a Prize Committee to counsel the Prime Minister on the list of those to
be submitted to the President to consider. So far the decisions to confer
Government literary and artistic prizes were signed in 2001, 2007 and 2012.  
Since the time the ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture’ came to life,
especially during the 1945-1954, activities of the party’s cultural
organizations and creative work of journalists, writers, artists has
diversified greatly. They have truly become the avant-guard troops on the
ideological and cultural front, contributing their due to the success of the
war of resistance against the French.  
Today, with correct and creative policies, our Party, Government and people
are building an advance culture, rich of national traditional features. In the
past, as at the present, culture is always a front, and writers and artists
are soldiers on that front. The revitalization of national culture in the
framework of renovation, constructing and defending the Socialist Fatherland
of Vietnam is proof of vibrant viability of the policies on culture and arts
put forward by our Party in the ‘Draft of foundations of Vietnam’s culture’.

**According to the documents of the Department of Cultural Heritage of the
Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Vinh Moc tunnels together with the
whole tunnel system of Vinh Linh, Quang Tri was named a National Special
Heritage in 2014.  
**

Vinh Moc tunnels in Vinh Moc Village, Vinh Thach Commune, Vinh Linh District
of Quang Tri Province have long been unforgettable names on the country’s map
of historical places. This ‘fiery land’ used to be called the ‘dead
coordinate’, being the target of enemy annihilation. But multimillions of tons
of bombs and shells raining from the sky and the fleets in the sea have failed
to destroy Vinh Moc’s historical, military, cultural and architectural values;
a symbol of bravery, resilience and the invincible vitality of the people of
Quang Tri.  
I chose to ride a bike for nearly 600km from Hanoi to Vinh Moc on a summer’s
day in late July.  
History came back in cool breezes blowing from the sea, in the bricks of the
vestige, rusted by time, and on the red earthen path covered with moss that
led to the tunnel entrance. Making slow, careful steps in the red light of the
torch, I followed the clear, soft voice of the young guide girl in the 1.1km
long maze of the tunnels.  
One of the peculiarities of these tunnels is the very gummy red basalt soil.
It made it easier for digging and kept the tunnel walls and ceiling strong
despite the close proximity of the sea. It also made it possible to dig big
lines, much bigger than the other tunnels elsewhere, so that people could move
easier. The entrances were about 2-3m away from the main line, so bombs that
hit them could not destroy the whole structure or kill the people inside.  
From 1965 to 1967, the people of Vinh Linh dug 114 big and small tunnels,
totaling 142km in length. Most of the tunnels have a ventilation hole every
50m, so each one has a few dozens of them. But Vinh Moc has only 2 ventilation
holes in all, and both serve only the 1st floor. The 2nd and 3rd floors below
have no such hole. Nevertheless, in all 3 floors it feels cool and airy, and
not stuffy anywhere. Some people explain that because Vinh Moc tunnel has 13
entrances, 6 of which open to the hills and 7 to the sea, in the right
direction to be able to suck in the air, so it feels dry and fresh even at the
depth of 15-23m under the ground.  
I went through all 3 levels at different depth with different functions. Level
1, 12m under the ground, served as offices for the party committee, the
people’s committee and the armed forces. There is a cafeteria in the main
axis. Level 2, 15m from the ground, is the dwelling space. Every 1-2m on
either side of the main axis, there is a deep hole which serves as a family
apartment. The guide girl told us there were 94 such apartments in the tunnel.  
Each apartment is only 2-3m2 in area, but could house 3-4 people at the same
time. On the same level 2 we were stunned to find a delivery room which
witnessed the birth of 17 of the total of 64 kids born in the tunnel systems
of Vinh Linh. Level 3, the deepest, 23m beneath the ground, is the bomb-proof
hiding place. As deep as it is, it’s still above sea level, and people lived
there relatively comfortably even in rainy season.  
Today, Vinh Moc has become a famous tourist attraction. Every day the site
receives hundreds of visitors.

**‘Ao dai and a life’s story’ is the name of the on-going exhibition at Ao dai
Museum in Ho Chi Minh City featuring 78 photo images of Madam Vi Kim Ngoc, the
wife of late Prof. Nguyen Van Huyen, Minister of Education of Vietnam (
1946-1975). The story was told by Mr Nguyen Van Huy *, the youngest son of
Prof. Nguyen Van Huyen and Madam Vi Kim Ngoc, currently Director of Nguyen Van
Huyen Museum.  
**

Growing up, I was enlightened by one thing: My mother was a lover of beauty,
with high self-esteem. Under any circumstance, be it the shortage of
necessities for life, or the hardship during nine years in the remote areas in
the mountains of North Vietnam or 10 years during the reform of the
bourgeoisie or 12 years of a fierce war, with the daily roar of aircraft or
the “time of eating wheat flour and barley” until she passed away, my mother
had always reminded me of nourishing good behavior, and inside-out beauty. She
often reminded her children and young people: if you fail to make yourself
beautiful, and do not respect yourself, how can other people respect you in
return?  
She handled haircare and makeup and dressed in a polite yet suitable way. She
loved the Aodai. Her life was attached to the Aodai. Times changed, but the
Aodai was always her hobby. She delicately amended the Aodai in line with the
trends and always wore an appropriate one.  
Fortunately, my mother, Madam Vi Kim Ngoc, kept many photos of her life of 72
years. Connecting the photos over the years, we have the opportunity to
understand more about a mother, a person who loved the Aodai. And also through
the story of a person who understands the “spirit” of the Aodai in the lives
of Hanoians.  
 **Youth  
** My mother was born in Lang Son, a province bordering China. Her
grandparents were from the coastal areas in Van Phan, Nghe An Province. They
followed King Le Loi for the struggle against China. Her grandfather then
gained the title of Duke and the land of Loc Binh to inherit for all time. For
five centuries their ancestors had mixed with local people to become the Tay
ethnic minority. My grandfather, Vi Van Dinh, was a mandarin in Lang Son, Cao
Bang then assigned to the provincial governor of Phuc Yen (1922), Hung Yen. At
the age of seven, my mother, a young woman in the mountainous region, first
came to live in the plains.  
My grandfather, on a weekly basis, would send my mother from Hung Yen to Hanoi
to study and learn drawing. My mother began to interact with the culture of
Hanoi. Her first Hanoi friends were her peers—children of Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen
Van Vinh, a well-known journalist and scholar at the time. Many family photos
of this period showed that she often wore Aodai going out, visiting pagodas,
historical sites, going to weddings or traveling to Phnom Penh or Angkor Wat.
My mother wore a white or a black Aodai. She had a collection of Aodais in the
1920s-1930s as the traditional, then the new styles of aodais (high neck, low
neckline), Cheongsam-style. (left photo)  
 **The wedding  
** In the spring of 1936, my parents were married. At that time, my mother was
the daughter of the governor of Thai Binh, and my father Nguyen Van Huyen, a
young Hanoian, had returned home after nine years studying in France with a
doctorate in literature and bachelor of law, a high and rare degree back then.
My parents chose the traditional costume for their wedding, in a society where
the trend was Western culture. When the groom’s family came down to pick up
the bride from Thai Binh, the bride was dressed in the trendiest fashion of
the time: a robe and a royal-patterned Queen Nam Phuong-style wedding dress of
vivid colors. The three bridesmaids and sisters of the mother were dressed in
modern white robes. The wonderful contrast between the bride and the gorgeous
costumes of the bridesmaids gracefully highlighted the solemnity of the
wedding. The groom and his brothers and his nephews, the groomsmen, were all
dressed in delicate Aodai with turbans.  
Following the custom of celebrating the second day of happiness, my parents
chose to dress in a modern way to come back to Thai Binh to show respect to
their parents. My father was wearing a black suit, white bow and mother wore
her hair up, in a white dress with a bracelet. They managed to take a
photograph of this important day.  
 **Mother and child  
** In 1937 my mother gave birth to her first child. I am the youngest, born in
1945. My parents were joyful. At this time, my father focused his research on
the history and culture of the nation in the École française d’Extrême-Orient.
His salary was high enough to support his family, so my mother did not go to
work but took care of the four of us at home. She often wore Aodais. She let
my sisters wear traditional aodais, or European-style dresses from time to
time.  
My parents’ nieces in the Nguyen family, the Vi family in Hanoi often wore
Aodais. Perhaps we were the last generation in Hanoi to wear Aodais as a
casual dress from a very young age.  
My eldest sister clearly remembered in a photograph taken before my father
went to the Fontainebleau Conference in 1946. All three sisters, herself and
Bich Ha and Nu Hieu, were dressed in red aodais and white silk trousers. My
mother appreciated this photo and spoke of it as a very beautiful memory. My
sister Hanh wrote about this in “Following Father’s Steps”.

**In the mountainous North Vietnam  
** During nine years living in the war zone, while in Phu Ninh, Phu Tho, or on
evacuation to Chiem Hoa, Tuyen Quang, my mother cleverly arranged the family
for my father, then Minister of Education, to have time to take care of the
country’s mission. The intellectual families were close together. Although
everyone was dressed in wartime clothes, they stood out with the elegance of
the Hanoians.  
Leaving Hanoi late 1946, my mother brought along many of her aodais. Wartime
offered very few chances to wear aodais, except for Tet holidays. Each time a
photographer came, the families gathered as for a festival. Adults and
children alike were given the opportunities to wear clothes brought along in
suitcases from Hanoi. The desire to dress nicely, with Aodai and wartime
clothes was reflected in these rare photos.  
At that time, we girls were growing up. Money for clothes was tight. My
mother, however, cleverly cut the clothes for the children from her precious
Aodais. “I still remember my mother selling her flowered aodais on Chiem Hoa
Street. She would pick one, then another, take a few of them and then put the
rest away. She told me about a memory with each aodai. Then there came the
next time my family needed the money. My mother retained a gown, the inside of
which was yellow, the chiffon blouse was red and the flowers were sewn on the
occasion of my uncle Nguyen Manh Tuong’s wedding. ” (Following Father’s Steps)  
My aunt was married in 1951. Perhaps this was the only chance for everyone to
dress up in aodais in a formal ceremony. My mother wore a delicate Aodai, the
one worn on her own wedding day. This aodai was handled with care until my
mother passed away. In 2005, we daughters decided to donate this aodai to the
Vietnam Museum of Ethnology for long-term preservation.  
 **Together again  
** In wartime, families were separated. Due to circumstances, some people
left, some stayed in Hanoi, but the love never faded. My mother’s sister had
to make a living by herself, and raising her kids in Hanoi. For nine years,
their love was kept warm via letters with nicknames. Sometimes she sent
“supplies” for two sisters in the forest.  
My mother wrote in her diary on the days of Geneva convention: “Oh, being
apart for eight or nine years, expecting the reunion, my hair was already
grey. The long-awaited day was about to happen. My beloved Kim Yen, we sisters
are about meet again. I miss you so. I long for it each day, to reunite with
my sisters. Kim Thanh was in deep water, I do not know if she can make it to
the capital so that the four sisters can be together. I hope Kim Thanh can
overcome all difficulties.”  
Nothing was happier than that reunion. Vi Kim Yen, Vi Kim Ngoc, Vi Kim Phu,
with their husbands, children and grandchildren took photos of this memorable
moment. The ladies wore formal Aodais. My mother regretted that her sister Vi
Kim Thanh was not in the picture, but in return, she had the presence of her
granddaughter in military uniforms.  
 **Happiness  
** When the children grew up, the country again was enduring war. My sisters
gradually married in 1965, 1966 and 1971. The wedding in wartime, though
simply held at home, was made in a sacred and solemn atmosphere. Aodais were a
concern for the brides. My mother advised the children to change their wedding
attire with their own colors at times such as meeting with the gown’s family,
or at the reception. She made Aodais for her children. My third sister, Nguyen
Kim Nu Hieu, was fortunate to have a piece of flowered cloth, bought on a trip
to China by her father, for her wedding aodai. Her mother gave her a
fashionable vinilon cloth to make clothes for the wedding. But the wedding
which was supposed to be crowded with relatives and friends did not take place
due to the flood of 1971. The bride and groom and the family decided the
wedding could be held with the presence of only two families. My sister was
wearing a flowered aodai as her wedding dress, and her vinilon dress, which
was not used, was kept as her memory until now.  
My mother also bought two white sheets of white and red parements for aodais
on my wedding day. My mother arranged the white aodai to be worn at the main
ceremony, the red aodai at the home reception.  
 **Nation’s pride  
** From 1955 to 1975, as the minister’s wife, my mother would accompany my
father in state celebrations such as the National Day of September 2nd, the
ceremony to welcome the heads of state or high-ranking officials of the
visiting countries or ambassadors. My mother would accompany my father to the
international reception with the ladies of the ambassadors. My mother was
always very thorough when it comes to dresses and makeup, as she thought her
presence was not only personal but also a matter of national pride. She often
chose Aodais to fit the seasons. When she went abroad with my father, she also
brought some of the best aodais.  
“I wish my daughters, sons, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law live together as
happily as we parents did, and at the same time, I hope you can hand the noble
traditions down to your descendants. From generation to generation, it is a
demand that you keep tradition in the family the way it was. “(My mother’s
will)

**Among the many that have come to Vung Tau, few know that at low tide, a path
emerges from under the water and connects the shore with a small islet, famous
with the much-revered Hon Ba Shrine.  
**

That 5,000m2 islet, named Hon Ba, is part of the Rear Bay of Vung Tau City, Ba
Ria – Vung Tau Province. The city is about 120km to the east of Ho Chi Minh
City.  
Hon Ba Shrine is much revered by the people who live here and in adjacent
provinces. They believe the host deity of Hon Ba Shrine is powerful and
merciful. That’s why incense never buns out inside the shrine. Most of the
people who come here are fishermen. They come to beg for favorable weather and
big catches in seafaring trips.  
It has been passed down that the shrine is dedicated to the Lady Dragon of the
Sea, the Guardian goddess of fishermen.  
An old story is still being passed around, that in 1939, a French officer
named Archinard fired his gun at Hon Ba. He fired many shots, but only one hit
the shrine’s outer corner. Later, the officer died by recklessly shooting his
gun. After that, the French named the island Archinard, but Vung Tau people
kept on using the name Hon Ba.  
The shrine was built in 1881 and renovated in 1971. Currently it is 4m high,
with an altar for offerings, and has a 6m long, 3m wide basement, which used
to be a secret meeting place of resistance fighters during the liberation
wars. Every year people conduct consecration rituals here 4 times in the 1st,
4th,7th and 10th lunar months.  
Pilgrims and tourists can walk to Hon Ba at the time low tide. The water is
the lowest at Hon Ba on the 14th and 15th days of lunar months.  
The path leading to Hon Ba is very rocky, rugged and full of razor-sharp
shells. So those who want to walk to the shrine should wear sturdy shoes and
keep in mind that the path is available only for a few hours before the sea
rises again. Visitor can also reach Hon Ba by boat when the path submerges
under a meter or so of sea water.  
Standing on Hon Ba, separated from the mundane everyday life, visitors can
wholeheartedly enjoy the grandeur of the blue sky, blue sea, the murmur of
water and bird chirping on age-old trees around the shrine.

Living in the rain forests of Southeast Asia, Vietnamese are well-connected to
the botanical world. Evolving out of the Stone Age, perhaps to the ancient
Viet people, wood was the next natural and suitable choice of material to use
for various purposes. Through generations, wood became one of the most popular
materials for making items that serve everyday life and spiritual needs of
humans. Our ancestors’ skillful hands and refined sense of beauty have created
a vast amount of wooden works that are still being used in households,
venerated worship places, or in solemn former royal palaces all over the
country.  
The Vietnam National Museum of History currently holds a large and diverse
collection of lacquered wood works which cover the whole span of the history
of the founding and development of the country. These invaluable relics are
proof of Vietnam’s age-old tradition of wood carving, lacquering and gilding
crafts. Archeologists have found countless lacquered wood works, unmistakably
locally made, in ancient graves in Viet Khe (Hai Phong Province), Chau Can
(Hanoi), Duong Du, Xuan La, Minh Duc, Chau Son, and many other places. Many
boat-shaped coffins, ironwood pillars, metal tools and weapons have also been
found in Dong Son vestige sites. That means wood has been used by Vietnamese
in matters of peace and war, life and death, work and worship since very early
ages.  
Along with ruling dynasties and spiritual life, wood carving, lacquering and
gilding crafts have been increasingly prospering in our country. Historical
records show that majestic palaces were all lacquered and gilded under the
Dinh and Early Le Dynasties. Under the Ly Dynasty, temples and palaces were
also decorated with glorious lacquered and gilded woodwork. The crafts most
flourished under the Le and Nguyen Dynasties (17th to early 20th Centuries.)
This cultural heritage is being respected and honored in the permanent
exhibition entitled ‘Red and gold – A collection of lacquered and gilded
woodwork’, which showcases a select part of the vast amount of woodwork
collected, studied and maintained by the Vietnam National Museum of History in
decades.  
Honoring these relics, we show our admiration for ancient masters who spared
no time and hardship to create invaluable works of art and transfuse their
soul into wood, lacquer and gold, in order to engrave their heartfelt message
for future generations about the traditions of nurturing love and gratitude to
the country, to its builders and defenders and to the ancestors, and about the
perpetual aspiration for a long and happy life for everyone. Our forefathers’
life philosophy, aesthetical mind and dexterity helped express historical and
cultural values, customs and religious beliefs of the Viet people.  
Among the artifacts preserved, the category of worshiped statues and altar
utensils is the most numerous. The statues include those of Three Era Buddhas,
Amit?bha, Avalokite?vara Bodhisattva, Newborn Shakyamuni, Bodhidharma, and The
Sacred Mother. The altar utensils include incense tables, altars, worship
chamber, worship beds, tablets, boxes of conferment letter, jars, vases,
weapon racks, parallel sentence and motto boards, intricately decorated with
classical themes of supernatural four, precious four, flowers, birds, and
calligraphic designs.  
These concrete, real items helped the museum staff to recreate lively scenes
of spiritual activities. Here is a village pagoda with an altar of Three Era
Buddhas, there is a temple or shrine with tablets of the tutelary god or an
ancestral altar. A religious procession with eight-pole palanquin or a village
festive day in an idyllic country side; everything can be reenacted within the
National Museum of History.  
Additionally, the topical exhibition also reserves a small space to introduce
the wood sculpture carving trade village Son Dong and the lacquering, gold and
silver laminating and gilding trade village Kieu Ky.  
Son Dong (Hoai Duc – Hanoi) is a thousand-year old trade village specializing
in carving wooden statues and worship utensils. Son Dong is most famous in
imitating antiques to serve refurbishing temples, pagodas, shrines, historical
and cultural vestige sites all over the country. The golden hands of talented
Son Dong artisans have created highly sophisticated pieces of art work. With
regard toKieu Ky village, the skill of its masters and strictly observed a
40-stage procedure of gold and silver processing make wooden statues, parallel
sentences and horizontal motto boards, shine splendidly. These two trade
villages used to be very prosperous. Having gone through ups and downs of
history in recent years due to the resurgence of religious activities, the
villages are having their Renaissance. Coming to Son Dong and Kieu Ky today,
we can witness firsthand the procedures of wood carving, lacquering and
gilding conducted under the merry symphony of saws, hammers and chisels
resounding all around.  
In Vietnam, wood processing in general and carving, lacquering and gilding in
particular are a cherished cultural heritage that has been passed down through
generations and has left for us an enormous amount of inheritance. This time
around, our exhibition will not only pay tribute to traditional handicrafts as
part of the nation’s cultural cream, but also help the public to better
understand artifact collection, and as a result, to raise awareness about
preservation, upholding and further enriching the values of national history,
culture and arts.

Way back in 2011, I wrote an article for one of the first editions of this
magazine about a visit to The Saigon Art Museum. Back then, I discovered quite
a dreary collection of art works and I practically had the place to myself. I
ended my piece with an appeal for renovation and pleading with the powers that
be to have some civic pride and establish an art museum worthy of a major
world city. Lo and behold, coincidence or not, a few months later work began
on a large new building to extend the place.  
Recently, relatives with solid backgrounds in art came to visit me and I had
the chance to accompany them to see the museum for the first time in six
years. The first indicator that the People’s Committee are serious about
promoting the art museum to all came with the entrance ticket. It is priced at
a mere VND10,000. All perhaps but poor students might well consider
contributing more with a drop of a few notes into the donation box. There was
now a steady trickle of visitors coming through the gates. Once inside I
discovered that the place has increased by leaps and bounds!  
What has not changed is the attraction of the buildings themselves. The
architecture is eclectic Chinese, Vietnamese and French with wooden shutters,
winding staircases, art-deco windows and an antique wooden lift with wrought
iron railings. There is also a charming courtyard with three tiers of open air
corridors around it. You can also buy art here. There are commercial galleries
out at the back of one of the three large buildings.  
The middle of these three buildings was housing an exhibition by a
contemporary artist on the day we visited. He had around forty works on
display, all of them a variation on a theme, quite abstract and in vivid
colours. Many artists I have noticed tend to do this and I understand if they
have work likely to sell well this is good for them, but it looked more like a
production line than a show of art.  
The building to the right as you enter is the one where you learn about and
enjoy contemporary Vietnamese art and that of the twentieth century. As my
kinsman Albert pointed out, you can see the influence of European and
especially French art. One picture looks definitely a Miro and another had a
Magritte-like train emerging out of nowhere. Albert was bemused that is so
difficult to find a Western history of art book in Vietnam and there was
certainly none in the museum shop.  
The third building was marked as antiquity but we are talking of hundreds of
years rather than thousands. No oil and canvass here, but works of art in more
durable materials such as stone, wood, brass and ceramics. There are a lot of
religious (Buddhist) works here. This section also takes you back in history
to the times of the Khmer, the Cham, Oc Eo civilisation and the early
settlers. I wondered why there were no paintings in this museum which predate
the twentieth century. ‘The French must have carted it all off,’ said Albert.
That being the case, it is high time since some of it were returned to its
rightful place here.  
My relative Albert took many great photographs that day and the examples shown
here should give you a good picture of what to expect should you visit
Saigon’s Art Museum. The city now has an Art Museum to be proud of and worthy
of your attention.  
The Fine Arts Museum Ho Chi Minh City is conveniently located near the Ben
Thanh Market at 98A Pho Duc Chinh St, District 1, HCMC.  
Entrance VND10,000, open 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. daily.

Rituals for the death anniversary of Le Van Duyet

Once the grave of a scurrilous rebel, the final resting place of Le Van Duyet
is revered all over the South. None of other tombs in the whole area of Saigon
– Gia Dinh can compare to the one of Le Van Duyet in size, impressiveness and
healing power, and none is so fervently worshipped and taken care of.  
Before 1975, the tomb’s triple gate with two palmyra trees on its sides was
chosen to be the symbol of Saigon (and of South Vietnam), just as Phuoc Duyen
Tower at Thien Mu Pagoda stands for Hue and Mid-Vietnam, and Single Pillar –
Dien Huu Pagoda stands for Hanoi and North Vietnam.  
Occupying an area of 18,500m2, standing on a knoll right next to Ba Chieu
Market, the Lord’s Tomb faces four streets: Dinh Tien Hoang, Phan Dang Luu,
Trinh Hoai Duc and Vu Tung. The premises is surrounded by a 500m long, 1.2m
high wall with four gates opening to four directions, built in 1948. The
Triple Gate was built the next year, opening to Vu Tung Street. Behind this
gate are the stele pavilion, the tomb, and the temple, in that order. With
brick walls and double-tile roofs, the stele pavilion looks like a shrine. The
stele is made of slate with carved Chinese text, eulogizing the merits and
legacy of Le Van Duyet. At the end, the text mentions his wife Lady Do Thi
Phan and Lord Phan Luong Khe (Phan Thanh Gian) who is also worshipped in the
temple.  
All these structures are built with Lindera myrrha mix in the bonding
material. The reliefs on the two screen walls, though simple, are especially
interesting. Mr Tran Van Sung, the chief Tomb Keeper, describes it thusly: the
front side of the front screen shows an eagle crouching on a tree, ready to
swoop down on a monkey trembling in fear. That was the power of Le Van Duyet
over the Siamese. The backside of this screen depicts two tigers, father and
son. The father in jumping position, with his front paws on a rock face, is
looking back toward the son behind him. The scene shows the affectionate love
of Le Van Duyet in his final days for his adopted son.  
The relief on the back screen depicts a dragon crouching in a cloud, a symbol
for nobility, in simplistic style. The screen has two handles on the sides in
the form of ‘leaves turning into dragons’. According to Mr Tran Van Sung, the
leaves turning into dragons motive was quite popular and used by in the old
times by artists to decorate wooden beams beneath temples’ roofs.  
The tomb contains two graves, the general’s and his wife Lady Do Thi Phan’s.
Both the graves look like half an egg covering a big rectangle slab, lying in
parallel. The graves are protected by a thick rectangle flat wall, which opens
at the front to a square with an incense burner.  
Behind the graves is the ‘Lord’s Sacred Shrine’ for worshippers to pray to Le
Van Duyet and conduct other rituals. The shrine consists of the front, the
middle and the main edifices, with East and West corridors on the sides. The
edifices, separated by a small open-air space, have curved roofs on top of
strong beams connected by simple tenons. Carved wood and stones and ceramic
inlay soften the solemnity of the tomb.  
Born in 1760 at Tra Lot River Fork (Cai Be, Dinh Tuong, now Tien Giang
Province,) he followed Lord Nguyen Anh in victory and defeat, even to Cambodia
and Laos. In May 1802, as Lord Nguyen Anh ascended to the throne, Le Van Duyet
became a founder of the dynasty.  
Later, asked by the King about the successor choice, Le Van Duyet opposed to
the King’s idea of deposing the elder line (of Prince Canh, who died at 22) to
establish the junior line (Nguyen Phuc Dam, later King Minh Mang.) King Minh
Mang resented him for this. Furthermore, he practiced his right not to kowtow
the King, granted by King Gia Long, every time he went to King Minh Mang’s
audiences. He used his ‘behead first, report later’ right to behead military
chief Huynh Cong Ly, father of a beloved concubine of the King, thus driving
the King mad.  
After he died, King Minh Mang removed the position of military head of Gia
Dinh, renamed it Phien An, and appointed Bach Xuan Nguyen as province chief
and Nguyen Van Que as province treasurer to govern it together. These two men
mistreated the men he trusted, causing Lieutenant Le Van Khoi (Le Van Duyet’s
adopted son) to rebel, kill the two men, and seize Phien An fortress in 1835.
It took the King’s army two years of siege to take down Phien An. All 1,831
people inside were executed. Minh Mang decreed to level Le Van Duyet’s grave
and carve a stone stele saying ‘This is where eunuch Le Van Duyet expiated his
crimes.’  
In 1841, as he ascended to the throne, King Thieu Tri reinstated wrongly
treated meritorious men, including Le Van Duyet. The man’s tomb in Gia Dinh
was built bigger, and his shrine renovated.

**Besides the tomb of the lord and his wife, there are also graves of their
two maids outside of the tomb’s premises. One is on Trinh Hoai Duc Street, and
the other on Dinh Tien Hoang Street (inside Ho Chi Minh City’s cadre school.)
On Dec 6, 1989, the Ministry of Culture named the tomb a National Relic of
Culture and History.

A mock-up of a naval battle on Bach Dang River

Located at the estuary of Bach Dang River, just 20km from downtown Hai Phong
Bach Dang Giang relic site (Trang Kenh – Thuy Nguyen) has become Hai Phong’s
largest complex of historical, cultural and spiritual monuments, as well as an
attractive tourist destination.  
Bach Dang estuary is a special place, the site of three great naval clashes, a
symbol of the spirit and heroism of a small nation that fought for freedom
multiple times against stronger aggressors.  
The first battle took place in 938BC, when the Southern Han’s 20,000-strong
navy, led by Hoang Thao, attacked us from the sea. When the news came, Ngo
Quyen gathered his generals and prepared to fight the enemy. He instructed his
troops to sharpen one end of wooden logs, cover them with iron, and plant them
in Bach Dang riverbed. At high tide, the logs were hidden under the water. Our
troops then used hit-and-run tactics to lure the Chinese fleet into the log
field.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Dang-huong-mot-trong-ba-den.jpg)  

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Dang-Huong-tai-Den-tho.jpg)

As the water receded, the Chinese ships got stuck in the ambush. Our men
sprang on them from the banks and small boats navigable between the logs.
After this victory, Ngo Quyen proclaimed himself King and restored the
sovereign nation of Vietnam. The Bach Dang victory was considered our
declaration of independence after a millennium under Chinese rule.  
In 981, the Song Chinese invaded our country again. Their navy, led by Hau
Nhan Bao, came upstream to Luc Dau Giang, lost a battle there and retreated
toward Bach Dang. Le Hoan had his troops plant wooden logs on the riverbed to
wait for them. Again, hit-and-run tactics helped lure the Chinese into the
trap just as the tide went low. Their ships pierced through, their men
crushed, even their top commander Hau Nhan Bao killed, the Chinese navy was
completely. This was the second Bach Dang victory that eternalized King Le Dai
Hanh’s name.  
The third Bach Dang battle is attached to the name of Tran Quoc Tuan, titled
Prince of Hung Dao, who helped the Tran Kings to defeat the Mongolian Yuan
armies. It was in 1288, when Mongolian hordes dominated the world, enslaved
China and terrorized Europe. Having been twice beaten in our country,
indignant and bewildered, they decided to try a third time.  
A tidal wave of 50,000 strong Yuan navy under Omar’s command moved into river
estuaries of Hai Phong. History recorded that ‘Great Viet army groups ambushed
them from behind caves and rocks, in small rivulets and on the banks of the
Trang Kenh and Quang Yen Rivers. The same tactics worked to lure the enemy
ships into the fields of sharpened logs for the main force to attack in a
major crushing counteroffensive at low tide. Over 400 ships and the commanders
Omar and Siragi were captured…’  
Many people feel that the remaining relics are not enough to reflect the
historical greatness of the Bach Dang victories. With that in mind, some
dedicated people have made great efforts to create a complex of monuments to
display the grandeur of the country’s spirit.  
In just a short time, a series of big projects have been put in place at Bach
Dang Giang relic site. First came a group of three big temples attached to the
names of the nation’s three great military commanders; King Le Dai Hanh,
National Regulator Tran Quoc Tuan (titled Prince of Hung Dao), and King Ngo
Quyen. All three temples follow an ancient architectural style and were built
with timber and rocks under the shade of age-old trees, along hill slopes and
river banks.  
A man from Minh Duc township named Mr Vu Duc H. said, ‘Unlike at other
construction sites, every year, Bach Dang Giang relic site gets enough
investment to have new additions to the complex, fulfilling the aspiration of
contributing visitors. As of now, besides the above- mentioned temples, the
relic site has also a temple for Chairman Ho Chi Minh, a museum with plans and
mock-ups of the three historical battles, a temple of the Mother-of-the-Land,
and a Buddhist pagoda above all that. Most recently, a very wide road was
completed, which leads to intricately carved stone bridges that add to the
monumental grandeur of three majestic statues of the military commanders
towering over the river. Beneath them the log fields have also been restored,’  
According to the site’s management, in the first half of the first lunar month
this year, they have received over 110,000 visitors. This lunar year, besides
the Spring festival, the Tran temple Seal Opening Festival on the 14th and the
anniversary of King Le Dai Hanh’s death on the 18th of the first lunar month,
to satisfy visitors’ aspiration, the relic site will organize many other
commemoration ceremonies on the occasions of Vesak in the 15th of the 4th
lunar month, Mother’s day on the 15th of the 7th lunar month, and the
anniversary of Prince Tran Quoc Tuan’s death on the 20th of the 8th lunar
month.

Vietnam National Bank on Nguyen Tri Phuong Street

**The streets and rivers of Hai Phong  
are rich with nostalgia**

Hai Phong is known not only for its famous tourist destinations such as Do Son
and Cat Ba, but also as one of the first developed sea ports of the country.
Traces of that development can still be found in the unique old quarters in
the downtown.  
The journey to rediscover the old streets in the center of the port city
begins from a century-old house at the piers of Lac Long Bridge. It was built
by the French in 1885 where Nguyen Tri Phuong Street begins. Today, it is the
office of the Hai Phong branch of Vietnam National Bank. All the base and
fender walls are built from tens of thousands of neatly cut 0.4-0.45m thick
blue limestone bricks, giving the house a distinctive look.  
Opposite the house are two old streets closely associated with the formation
and development of the harbor city. Winding along dreamy Tam Bac River, Tam
Bac Street used to be booming with busy docks and hectic river traffic. There
was rarely such a street so favored by the artists and so present in their
creations. Oil paintings and verses eternalized life on this age-old street
during that remarkable period. Hai Phong used to have many streets such as
Quang Trung and Nguyen Duc Canh Streets along Lap River, and Lach Tray Street
along Lach Tray River providing easy access to docks and being convenient for
trades. But today, due to urbanization, only Tam Bac Street somehow has
managed to preserve the old look, reminding us of the times of hectic docking
and loading.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Nha-Hat-lon-dau-xuan.jpg)  
Hai Phong Opera House opened in 1912 on Hoang Van Thu Street

Running in parallel with Tam Bac, Ly Thuong Kiet Street has also preserved
many features of the old architecture. Houses here open to both of these
streets. Walls yellowed by time, high and narrow wooden doors of long and
narrow houses with double tiles reveal their Chinese origins. This street used
to be called ‘Guest Street’, because the Chinese made up the major part of its
inhabitants. Here and there, French villas built in the early 20th century in
the Gothic style with small windows opening high up under curved domes, making
the street a melting pot of Oriental and Occidental cultures. House no. 14 of
Rice Alley (today’s 61 Alley) used to be an important liaison post of the
Vietnam Communist Party before the August Revolution.  
The area between the end of Ly Thuong Kiet and Tam Bac Streets is criss-
crossed by many small alleys. All of them have names, but even the Hai Phong
people rarely remember all of them. Among these are Trang Trinh, Ky Con and
Hoang Ngan. Folks simply call the whole area the Ruined Bazaar or Tam Bac
Bazaar. This is one of the very first and busiest bazaars of the city. Here,
wholesalers hawk all sorts of goods. Shops and kiosks are arranged in a
chessboard-like manner with crossing paths separating them. In the middle,
there is a stele telling the story of an atrocity by the Americans in 1972
when they bombed and destroyed the entire marketplace. Since then, people have
called it the Ruined Bazaar.  
Cau Dat is another old street that almost all of Hai Phong’s guests have
visited. During the French rule, it was called the ‘wealth funnel.’ In those
days, Cau Dat used to be considered Hai Phong’s richest street, with many
famous handicraft trades such as shoemaking, quilt making, sweets and food,
grocery, photo and jewelry shops. Today, Cau Dat is not only a bustling
business area, but it has also managed to preserve the old fame as the
traditional sweet trade center of Hai Phong, similar to the Hang Duong Street
of Hanoi. Each shop, such as Dong Phuong, Thanh Lich, Nhu Y and Song Kim, is a
family business with secret recipes and formulas for the distinctive flavors
of their products that draw multitudes of buyers and make the trade so
blissful, especially during the Mid-Autumn and New-Year holidays. Even the
simple fried rice donuts with paper-thin, crispy skin and silky stuffing are
also a delight of passersby.  
Hai Phong has not only busy streets where any hour is a rush, but also tender,
nostalgic corners of Hoang Van Thu, Dinh Tien Hoang, and Ho Xuan Huong
Streets. Mythically hidden amidst the hectic downtown, life suddenly seems
quiet; a world away with century-old villas covered in moss and weathered by
time. Passing under the canopy of big, old, year-round green trees of these
dormant streets, people seem to slow down to enjoy a peaceful moment amongst
the whirlpool of modern life.  
Strolling on crowded commercial streets, sipping hot coffee in a sidewalk
coffee shop, or nibbling some simple nosh with a cup of thick tea while
everything around is blurred in the spiraling aromatic tea vapor on a cold
winter day is an experience of the harbor city that no one will ever forget.

A national treasure is a precious relic that carries messages from the past,
the quintessence of rich, diverse and unique Vietnamese culture. This is the
first time the Vietnam National Museum of History will exhibit the ‘National
Treasures of Vietnam’ at the Vietnam National Museum of History on January 10,
2017 at no. 1 Trang Tien Street, Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi to the public.  
According to Dr. Nguyen Van Cuong, Director of the Vietnam National Museum of
History, this is a special event. Previously the national treasures have been
shown separately in topical exhibition, but this time, these invaluable
national relics are showcased to provide a panoramic view of the history of
Vietnam as a nation, from the Dong Son Era 2,000 years ago to the time of the
establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Some, such as That Khe
antiques, show the dawn of our history, when our people began the process of
building and defending our own nation and civilization. Others such as royal
seals show different eras of different dynasties.  
The exhibition this time presents two items recently recognized by the
National Council of Heritage, namely the Nation Handing Down Seal related to
the Nguyen Dynasty’s legacy of expanding the territory and unifying
administration system, and a Tran Era’s 8-petaled ceramic vase, a masterpiece
that demonstrates the innovative mind and skills of the Viet people in this
period of long strides of development in military (3 times defeating the Yuan
aggressors), economics and culture.  
Beside the antiques, the exhibition also introduces to the public the
artefacts related to the nation’s destiny in the fight for independence, the
establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the struggle for the
country’s unification. These include the famous ‘Call for nationwide
resistance’ and the ‘Prison diary’ authored by the world-celebrated cultural
icon, Chairman Ho Chi Minh.  
‘In this exhibition, the Vietnam National Museum of History will be innovative
in accentuating the values and meanings of the showcased items to visitors by
lay-out, light design, and 3-D illustrations, providing detailed documentary
clips about the process of research and evaluation and X-ray images of pattern
designs to emphasize the unique values of each item.’  
Other relics, which cannot be included in the exhibition due to their
tremendous sizes and weights such as a 6th century Champa King’s stele, or the
Nam Giao stele where Nguyen Kings conducted a ritual asking Heaven for good
weather and crops will be shown comprehensively in images and texts.

In our ‘Instagram age’ when every day, millions of photographs are instantly
uploaded to websites and almost as quickly forgotten, it is a joy to pick up
and leisurely thumb through an album of old black-and-white pictures. It is a
particular joy when that album blows away the mists of time and shows you
captured instants of the past life of a city you know and love. Although I
have lived in Vietnam for twenty years, I cannot claim to know Hanoi well,
having only visited it on a number of business trips that hardly reaches
double figures. After an absence of ten years, I went back last year and was
struck by the large numbers of skyscrapers that have sprung up. Yet, the old
Hanoi with its thousand-year history is still there. I stayed near the Temple
of Literature and walked the ancient streets shown in this book. For those
with a love and nostalgia for past times and of that grand old dame named
Hanoi, this is a tome to seek out.  
There is more text here than you generally get in a book of this kind. Many of
the photographs need to have their context explained and clarified. There is a
very good introductory essay on the long history of Hanoi, among other things
lamenting the fact that besides the great exception already mentioned of the
Temple Of Literature, very little remained even at the time of these snaps
that is more than two hundred years old. The credits at the back make it clear
the English has been vetted by native speakers and they have done a good job
making it read clearly throughout. I shall now proceed to give you a section
by section overview of the book.

**Markets  
** Street and municipal markets will always be the best place to experience
the essence of a place — the character of the local people and the nature of
their economy. All the more fascinating to see markets at moments frozen in
time of a hundred years ago and more.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1-182.2-OK.jpg)

That young flower girl in the picture there probably grew old, become a mother
and then a grandmother; perhaps even I have brushed shoulders with her
descendants on a Hanoi street. It is interesting to learn that the nickname
for Hanoi in the past was simply ‘The Market’. The sellers and buyers may be
attired and look differently now, but it was the same bustling activity as in
today’s Vietnamese markets. We see goods back then were carried to market on
strange-looking wooden barrows and also balanced atop the seller’s head. As
now there was a separate area for live chickens due to, as we are told, the
foul smell. Also in this section, we see wooden boats moored alongside the Red
River near the Dormer Bridge, vital for the inflow of agricultural produce and
merchandise to the markets. There are also sellers using quaint old buses to
get to market.

**The Thirty-Six Guild Streets**

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1-51-Good.jpg)

Partly due to a recent ‘renovation’, this is the area of Hanoi that best
maintains its old character. Each of the thirty streets were occupied by
craftsmen from various villages or some by the Chinese specialising in certain
businesses such as gold, silver, dyeing, and silk. We see most of the houses
were of earthen walls and bamboo roofs. Only the Chinese had houses of brick.
The actual number of guilds was not a constant thirty-six but changed from
time to time. This section provides many snapshots of Hanoi forbears tending
their shops, producing goods and transporting them through the bustling narrow
streets.

**Hanoi Citadel  
** Sadly, the French levelled the Hanoi citadel in 1894. Only the flag tower,
the North Gate and a few buildings inside the citadel remain today. Thus the
photographs and drawings shown here are of enormous value. It seemed quite
like the Hue Citadel, which of course, we can still see. There are the high
walls, the gates, store house and dwellings of high officials, as well as
shots of the Royal Palace and of the King himself amidst his entourage.

**Old City Trades  
**  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/50.2-Good.jpg)

This section shows Hanoians of yesteryear at their everyday toil. Captured in
1884, a middle-aged woman sits weaving at a large wooden loom. We learn that
people used to make their living fishing from the many Hanoi lakes. Rice
husking kept many busy. Blacksmiths and turners turn out their wares. As
today, people are making conical hats in their yards. There are oil pressers,
parasol and umbrella makers, wood carvers, painters and decorators,
embroiderers, people transporting goods by wooden wheel barrows and rickshaw
carriers of people. Add to this scholars commissioned to write letter an
calligraphic art, itinerant shoe menders and cobblers, makeshift tea shop
owners, street barbers, street musicians and even those who worked as human
chess pieces!

**West Lake  
**  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/173-OK.jpg)

This is the largest of Hanoi’s lakes, so called as it lies west of the river.
The French called it ‘Grand Lac’ As evidenced here by many pictures of old
temples and palaces, this was a gentrified and royal area. However many
commoners made their livings here fishing, cultivating lotus flowers on the
waters and a snap of the ancient ‘Cau Giay’ (Paper Bridge) leads us on to the
many paper-making villages that were once around the lake, taking their raw
material from the waterside trees. We see the stages of paper making from the
stripping of bark, pulping, ovens for the boiling of the mash, and softening
by dumping in ponds. Coming from a paper-making town myself, I found this
intriguing. Finally, there is a shot of the people of Buoi (Pomelo) Village,
which held an important local market

**Hoan Kiem Lake  
**  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1-561.jpg)

The heart of Hanoi was and remains the Lake of the Restored Sword (Hoan
Kiem).It is amazing to see the famous temple on the small island (Ngoc Son)
used to be accessed by a bamboo plank bridge more suited, as is the quote by a
Frenchman, ‘to a light-footed goat than the heavy steps of Europeans’. There
were more pagodas around the lake. There is a picture of a large beautiful
one, sadly razed by the French to make way for the post office. Hanoi’s first
theatre near the lake ‘Les Varietes’ is also depicted, along with a long gone
bandstand in a nearby square. Another sad loss, we learn was the magnificent
‘Cercle Nautique’, a lovely colonnaded building in the form of a pleasure boat
that once stood at the water’s edge and served as a popular cafe.

**New Look Hanoi**

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/213-Good.jpg)

The last section comes closer to our times. It is basically about what the
French did to try to convert Hanoi into a Paris of the Orient. (‘What did the
Romans ever do for us?’ is a famous anti-colonial comic cry from ‘Monty
Python’’). Well, here we see with their knack for flair and elegance, that the
French brought some very fine administrative buildings, hotels and cafes,
libraries, pharmacies and theatre, not to mention a power plant, improved
water treatment facilities and the railway. The streets with horses, rickshaw
pullers and early motor cars look very quiet compared to today’s hectic rush.  
All in all, for those interested in seeing how Hanoi looked and how its people
lived in the early era of photography, this book is very good value for money.
If you live in Hanoi or on your next visit, you will walk her streets with
different eyes and you may even imagine you see one of two of those ghostly
personages you glimpsed in the book.

An iron lamp rack in the form of ivory bamboo decorated with dragon and
phoenix

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/IMG_8773-copy.jpg)  
A lamp rack with ‘nine dragon formation’

**Early 20th century lamp collection at the  
Vietnam National Museum of History**

Lamps are part of human daily life and spiritual activities. The Vietnam
National Museum of History has a collection of lamps starting from the Bronze
Age, the era of Dong Son civilization, (most notably, the one in the shape of
a kneeling man found at Lach Tuong, Thanh Hoa), through the subsequent
historical periods until the era of Nguyen Dynasty in early 20th century.  
The collection includes iron lamp racks in the form of a dragon, phoenix,
‘ivory bamboo decorated with dragon and phoenix,’ ‘nine dragon formation’ and
wooden lamp stands in the form of ‘ivory bamboo turned dragon,’ or decorated
with elephants, dragons, apricot blossom and lotuses. Made in the themes of
four marvels, four seasons, flowers and plants, they demonstrate skilful
craftsmanship and the sophisticated sense of beauty of ancient artisans.  
The 1.5m tall rack in the form of ivory bamboo decorated with dragon and
phoenix is an original one. It has a trunk in the form of ivory bamboo, with
dragon heads and bodies flaring out of its branches. The bamboo tree is also
decorated with the four season symbols which are pine, mum, bamboo and
apricot.  
Hanging on the bamboo branches are the phoenixes whose flapping wings serve as
lamp plates. The bird seems harpooning downwards but its head is turning up
with its crest like a waving flag.  
The combination of dragon, phoenix and the four season theme is a style
prevalent in decorative art during the Nguyen Dynasty.  
The ‘nine dragon formation’ is another bright example of this era’s art. The
nine dragons form the support, their heads half hidden in clouds. They are
supposedly spitting water to bath the newborn Buddha. The 28 lamp plates
arranged in four directions stand for the 28 stars used by astrologists to
predict weather and human fates. This is a typical combination of Buddhism and
Confucianism seen throughout Eastern Asia.  
The carved wooden stands are another interesting part of the collection. The
one decorated with elephants, dragons, apricot blossom and lotus is a
remarkable example. Three softly curving dragons form a strong support for the
1m tall stem. The dragons are bathing among apricot and lotus flowers. In the
upper part, little elephants stand in lotus-like lamp plates, their prominent
forehead being the stand for an individual lamp. The whole piece is a work of
art, embodying Buddhist and Confucian concepts, national characteristics and
folklore themes.  
The collection of lamp rack and stands shows how our people used light in
everyday life, official ceremonies, festive activities and religious rituals.
To a certain extent it also reflects the life content, transformation of ideas
and development of cultural interpretation.

_  
Vietnam National Museum of History inherits and upholds the reputation of 50
glorious years of its predecessors, the Museum of History of Vietnam and the
Vietnam Museum of Revolution, and the leaders with rich traditions who
contributed greatly to the cause of protection, preservation and promotion of
national cultural heritage. Since their founding, the two museums were always
closely monitored by Chairman Ho Chi Minh (he visited them 8 times) and other
leaders of the Party and Government. On Sep 22, the Vietnam National Museum of
History had the honor of receiving from the Party and Government the First
Rank Medal of Labour to celebrate the 5 year anniversary of its establishment
(Sep 26, 2011 – Sep 26, 2016). Also on this occasion, the Vietnam National
Museum of History opens the ‘Reform Period – The journey of dreams’ exhibition
to celebrate 30 years of the country’s reform (1986 – 2016).

**A Special Exhibition about Reform Period**

**‘Reform Period – The journey of dreams’ is a special exhibition designed
with about 200 artifacts, documents and images from the Vietnam National
Museum of History’s collection, combined with stories, introductions, and
quotes…  
** Through many documents, artifacts, audio clips, stories of politicians,
researchers and common folks, ‘Reform Period – The journey of dreams’ conveys
to visitors images and information about an important historical period of the
country. Behind the changes and achievements are the spirit of creativity and
aspiration for innovation nurtured in each person.  
The exhibition space presents 5 major topics:  
 **1\. Reform Period or death:** presenting reasons for Reform Period,
reformation philosophy and policies and the role and legacy of politicians,
who initiated, led and organized the mission of rebuilding the country.  
 **2\. The opportunity:** economic reforms open chances for Vietnam to
develop.  
 **3\. Dynamics – Integration:** The Reform Period made Vietnamese people more
dynamic and opened up the country to integrate with the world community
through exchange, cooperation, import and export.  
 **4\. Growth:** The Reform Period transformed Vietnam from a food importer to
the second biggest rice exporter of the world. After 30 years of Reform
Period, Vietnam’s socio-economic infrastructure has developed quickly with
many modern constructions that truly face-lifted the country.  
 **5\. Strength:** The Reform Period has improved the people’s life in terms
of healthcare, education and culture; refreshed and boosted the life and work
of each person, each family and brought renewed faith and strength for Vietnam
to move steadily toward prosperity.  
The exhibition also has a separate space, called the ‘Wall of Memories’, for
visitors to express their recollections about the Reform Period period.  
The exhibition also impresses visitors with a humane approach, introducing
voices and popular slang through stories and artifacts about the Reform
Period. Media equipments supplements with more comprehensive information, such
as clips of interviewed specialists and common people, for the showcased
content.  
Through this exhibition, the Vietnam National Museum of History would like to
receive more stories, materials and artifacts about Reform Period from the
public in order to further improve and enrich the exhibition.

**_Neglect mars the legacy of two Vietnamese heroes_**

**The Prologue  
** She used to hang out on that circle of the roundabout between the Ben Thanh
Market and the downtown bus station in Ho Chi Minh City. She must have got
bored and lonely, for now she shares company, a quarter of a mile away, with a
bronze, studious young man who is a permanent fixture in that little park
opposite the Municipal Museum on Ly Tu Trong Street. You can see them there
any day of the week. Just who they are only the locals – and not many of them
these days – would know. Let me tell you readers of English of their sad and
noble stories and why you will see them there.  
This is no star-crossed romantic couple, although their ages; the girl fifteen
and the boy nineteen closely fit Romeo and Juliet. Romance was not theirs, but
only tragedy, not intertwined but separate. They will remain forever young.
You may have guessed by now I am talking about two statues raised in memoriam
of teenage Vietnamese martyrs.

**The Maiden’s Tale  
** The girl’s name was Quach Thi Trang. The statue consists of her head
mounted on a plinth. Judging from this, she had masses of snowy white curly
hair and a rather chubby face. The plinth in minimal; words only records her
as a female martyr and a victim. This monument was moved here in 2014 to make
way for the construction of the underground railway. She died in a protest
against the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem. The latter was an ardent
Catholic who had originally intended to become a priest. His tenure was marred
by his blatant favouritism of his own religion to the detriment of the
Buddhists. Matters had already come to head in the spiritual capital of Hue
where he had banned the flying of the Buddhist flag. A Buddhist monk in Saigon
had burned himself to death in protest. Then in August 1963, special armed
forces mounted an attack on the Xa Loi Temple in Saigon killing thirty monks,
ransacking the place and pulling out the precious stone eyes of a statue of
the Buddha. They went on to attack other major temples on the same day. Such
was the outrage that the very next day, thousands of students gathered in
front of the main gate of the Ben Thanh market. Peaceful methods of crowd
dispersal were tried before live ammunition was fired, gunning down Trang who
was one of the student leaders in the forefront. This tragedy brought
thousands more onto the streets and among older people brought to mind the
killing of our youth back in the year 1950.

**The Youth’s Tale  
** Whilst information on Trang’s monument is scant, that on the young man’s is
non-existent. Not even the name is mentioned on the plinth. When it was
erected over ten years ago, I immediately recognised it as identical to a
statue I had seen by a lake in the city of Ben Tre. It is of Tran Van On, who
was born in Ben Tre province in the Mekong Delta. He was a studious young man
as depicted in the statue carrying a book under his shoulder. He was a model
student who would have had a bright future. He was studying for the
baccalaureate at the Petrus Ky high school in Saigon. He was also a pillar of
the student anti-French occupation movement. On 8 January, he was shot in the
stomach while in a large crowd asking for the release of detained students. He
was taken to the Cho Ray hospital but did not survive. His death sparked much
consternation, with as many as twenty-five thousand people attending his
funeral.

**Conclusions  
** In a city with too few green areas, this pretty little park attracts many
people. People come here to eat their packed lunches. There are exercising
machines which are popular with the locals. There two amazing tall trees
covered in strangler vines. I often see tourists having their photos taken
there. Behind the girl’s statue here is a large open-area cafe. A park or
garden is also a place for reflection. It is exactly the right place to
remember these tragic young lives lost. Many curious people will see these
figures and wonder just who they were and never go beyond that. All we need is
just a couple of plaques giving the basic biographic details. After all, in
the museum opposite every exhibit is clearly labelled and explained.  
They say that a country that does not know its past will have an unsure
future. History is important and we need as any reminders of past events as
possible. I asked several young educated Vietnamese about these two heroes.
They were all familiar with the names but nobody knew their stories.
Information in Vietnamese is needed. As this is a location frequented by
foreigners, translation into English and other languages would also be useful.
Perhaps an embassy of foreign organisation could sponsor this. Information is
a weak point in Vietnamese tourism. Even at quite major attractions there is
no pamphlet available either for free or on sale. Tourist information offices
are almost non-existent. When you do see a capital ‘I’ sign it is just a crude
trick to get you to enter a travel agent’s. I was recently in Australia, where
every small town has an Information Centre packed with tips for the visitors
and staffed with volunteers anxious to promote their local area and country. I
know it costs money, but surely this would be a good investment for Vietnam.
At least, dear reader, should you visit; you now are ‘in the know’.

Association of Vietnamese in France during the last 100 years. The exhibition
will open at Ho Chi Minh Museum on Aug 18, 2016 in Paris, and several other
French cities by mid-Sept, 2016.

  * **Publishing photobook, Ho Chi Minh related places in France**

The book concentrates on places related to Mr Nguyen Ai Quoc’s life, work and
activities in France during the 1911, 1917-1923, and 1946 years. Some were
visited by Nguyen Ai Quoc very briefly, just for a meeting or conference, but
some had been visited by him frequently. Besides the detailed information
about the places and the time Nguyen Ai Quoc – Ho Chi Minh – had been there,
the book also provides valuable imagery.

  * **Publishing Special issue no. 52 of Infomaterials on the topic of Ho Chi Minh and France.**

  * **Launch of documentary film entitled, ‘Places in France related to Ho Chi Minh – eternal values’**

The film ‘Places in France related to Ho Chi Minh – eternal values’ doesn’t
follow the chronological order of events related to Chairman Ho Cho Minh’s
activities in France. It focuses on presenting the places and relics about
and/or related to Ho Chi Minh in a sensible way and the stories and memories
that the locals may have about Ho Chi Minh, their attitude toward Him and
those relics.  
The film also shows the activities of the Vietnamese side, especially of the
Vietnamese community in France, and the sympathy and support they received
from the French in preserving and promoting the image of Chairman Ho Chi Minh
among the people of the two countries.

  * **Meeting the witnesses**

Ho Chi Minh Museum arranges meetings with the families of the intellectuals
who followed Chairman Ho Chi Minh back home in 1946 and their invaluable
contributions to Vietnam’s revolution.

  * **Exploring and experiencing ‘Hue, the cradle of Chairman Ho Chi Minh’s childhood’**

The educational program ‘Hue, the cradle of Chairman Ho Chi Minh’s childhood’
includes activities related to the ‘land of Hue’ in late 19th and early
20thcenturies. Lively illustrated infopannels introducing Hue of the time of
His youth, combined experiences of ‘Family culture’ and ‘Learning with a
scholar’ in which kids learn to sew, mend, embroider, process harvested rice,
make betel quid under the instruction of an artisan, and attend classes where
a Confucian scholar teaches them to write basic Chinese characters will give
children a clear idea about the traditional cultural values of family in
ancient times.  
Besides the educational package, the museum also has a separate space for kids
to enjoy fun activities and traditional games such as lion dance, bagged race,
flag seizing, rope skipping, tug of war, etc.  
These physical activities help develop motor skills, coordination, teamwork,
friendship and comradeship, and bring fun, relaxation and diversity to a
session packed with new information and inspiration.  
Time: scheduled from 12 September to 16 September, 2016.  
Venue: the outdoor space of Ho Chi Minh Museum.

The Vietnam National Museum of History is currently holding a vast collection
of over 200,000 precious items, rich in material and cultural diversity,
vividly displaying the life of humans from prehistoric times. Many are one of
a kind, historically representative and invaluable.  
Based on the National treasure classification criteria, the Museum has
proposed a list for the Antique Assessing Committee of the Ministry of
Culture, Sport and Tourism and the National Cultural Heritage Committee to
assess and to present to the Minister of Culture, Sport and Tourism.
Consequently, the Prime Minister had signed Decisions to recognize 16 National
Treasures. The Museum is documenting other relics that meet the criteria to
submit to the Committees.

The statue of Nguyen Trung Truc

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Side-Altar-2.jpg)_  
An altar in the shrine

The commander stands straight and tall on his pedestal, his sword partly
drawn. His uniform is from a former age. The lifelike statue of Nguyen Trung
Truc guards the entrance to his house-shrine. I am in the town of Rach Gia in
Kien Giang Province for the week-long October festival in honor of the hero, a
Vietnamese leader who fought the French takeover of Vietnam in the nineteenth
century.  
In the long Vietnamese tradition of venerating heroes, the greater pantheon of
those who fought the Chinese and Mongol  
invaders over the centuries is known to all. Tran Hung Dao, the Trung sisters
Hai Ba Trung, Le Loi, Nguyen Trai and others appear as names of streets,
schools and on a myriad of institutions. The lesser pantheon is made up of
heroes, statesmen and scholars from later periods whose veneration and
reputations have fluctuated over the centuries with the changes in dynasties
and regimes.  
Nguyen Trung Truc’s place, however, seems secure. Although his festival
includes parades, speeches by dignitaries and many  
special events, this is a hero that belongs to the people, and the heart of
the festival takes place in the streets.  
Several days before the festival begins, an ad-hoc market is set up where used
clothes from all over the world are sold at rock-bottom prices. My Vietnamese
colleague and I spent one morning looking through stall after stall of men’s
shirts. The labels from France, Italy, Russia, Japan and a host of other
countries were fascinating with their different languages and sizes. With
prices ranging from VND20,000 for well-worn shirts to VND70,000 for better
quality dress shirts,we decided to buy two for luck. Given the different
systems of sizing, there was nothing we could do but try them on.  
The next day, we dismissed class early and headed with a group of students to
the shrine. The streets around were filled with tables, with hammocks strung
everywhere. The present building is built on the site of earlier shrines going
back to the 1800’s, when locals covertly honored Nguyen Trung Truc in spite of
French repression. It is in the ancient Chinese house form of one wide room in
front and two smaller rooms behind. Passing the hero’s commanding statue, we
entered the main room.  
The shrine was ornately decorated and an arch of yellow  
chrysanthemums surrounded the altar. Incense filled the packed room like a
gray cloud as hundreds of people offered prayers and  
petitions to their hero. Nguyen Trung Truc’s help is considered  
especially efficacious, since he surrendered his life voluntarily in  
exchange for hostages held by the French.  
We drifted through the crowd to the back rooms, which are filled with
artifacts, mementos from Truc’s life and paintings of the battles in which he
led the people. A large diorama depicts his burning of a French ship at Nhat
Tao village. A painting shows the leveling of the French ramparts at Rach Gia.
The French soon retook the site and executed him on October 27, 1868.  
We returned to the streets, which had been turned into a huge outdoor dining
room with tables everywhere. A volunteer led us to a large round table for
twelve. As we sipped our tea and talked, one of the festival organizers
approached and greeted us in excellent English. He answered our questions and
explained that over eight hundred volunteers had worked and were still working
to prepare the 170,000 free vegetarian meals they expected to serve during the
week. Over five hundred tons of produce and foodstuffs had been donated by
local merchants and others farther afield. We were served a variety of
traditional dishes and the food was quite good.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Inside-the-shrine.jpg)  
Inside the shrine

Pilgrims come from all over the province and neighboring provinces as well.
Five hundred hammocks were strung along the streets, and we were told that
more than five hundred more were available at other shrines and temples
throughout the city for those with no place to rest or sleep. While the
festival primarily serves the poor, nearly everyone in Rach Gia tries to eat
at least one meal at the festival in honor of Nguyen Trung Truc. The
volunteers feel they are serving the people in the spirit of their hero as he
would have done.  
Beginning with the Trung sisters’ revolt in 40 AD, the Vietnamese have fought
foreign invaders for nearly two thousand years. Their  
indomitable spirit is supported by the active memory and veneration of their
heroes, and they unite with their past to fight for a better future. Ancient
legends tell of the Trung sisters and others who reappeared centuries after
their deaths to fight for the people against the foreign invaders. I was told
that some of the local people believe Nguyen Trung Truc will also return if
Vietnam is again attacked from outside. May Vietnam always have such heroes as
Nguyen Trung Truc!

The Vietnam National Museum of History was established by merging the Vietnam
Museum of History and the Vietnam  
Museum of Revolution under Decision No. 1674/Q?-TTg, signed by the Prime
Minister on Sep. 26, 2011.  
The Vietnam Museum of History was one of the earliest established, based on
what was then the Louis Finot Museum of the École Française d’Extrême-Orient,
built in 1929 and opened in 1932. The building was designed as a work of art,
a special architectural edifice which  
harmoniously combined Oriental and Occidental styles and elements of
expression. In 1958, the Vietnamese government officially took over this
cultural treasure, adding content and transforming it from a  
museum of Eastern culture into the Vietnam Museum of History. On Sep. 3, 1958,
the Museum was opened to receive visitors.  
The Vietnam Museum of Revolution was based in the building of the Indo-China
Chamber of Commerce, built by the French in 1917. In 1954, after the North of
Vietnam was liberated, the government under Chairman Ho Chi Minh decided to
start collecting content on the  
history of Vietnam since the mid- 19th century to showcase in this  
building as the Vietnam Museum of Revolution. The Museum was opened Jan. 6,
1959. These were the top and very first Museums of the Democratic Republic of
Vietnam.  
The Vietnam National Museum of History inherited all the assets and over half
a century of expertise and success of the Vietnam Museum of History and the
Vietnam Museum of Revolution. The two museums have done a great job of content
collection and classification, museum management, staff development and
building relations with other  
museums, both domestic and international. The vast volume of assets that the
Museum now possesses includes over 200 thousand  
documents, pictures and artefacts reflecting the flow of national history from
stone age to modern times, among which there are many national treasures and
many of the rarest, most valuable antique collections as compared to similar  
museums in the country and the region.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/-nhhthngtrungbyti.jpg)_

As head of the system of museums of  
Vietnam, and as the one attracting the highest  
number of foreign visitors, our Museum has  
adjusted and reoriented its operations, and adapted itself to the ever-
changing requirements of society. We have achieved some initial remarkable
success in content delivery by modern mediums, such as auto guiding in
Vietnamese and English, or through our website, which is available in
Vietnamese, English and French and is accessed over seven  
million times a year. Tens of thousands of pupils attend our ‘I love History’
and ‘History in artefacts’ Clubs every year. We organized major expeditions
and archaeological excavations, special  
exhibitions in the country and abroad, conducted research,  
compilation and publication of materials, took part in domestic and
international conferences, maintained and restored artefacts. We chaired some
major projects such as ‘Content Building and Showcasing at Vietnam National
Museum of History.’ We sent our staff to training courses both in the country
and abroad. The  
indoor and outdoor displays are constantly updated with new  
content and improved with advanced technology and modern  
exhibition styles in order to create the best possible effect and satisfy
higher and higher requirements of the public.  
Significantly, the Vietnam National Museum of History is one of the few
national museums of Vietnam that has achieved  
resounding success in its exhibitions abroad, promoting the  
country and the people of Vietnam through national heritage, helping the
international community have better, more complete understanding of the
history and culture of Vietnam.  
The Vietnam National Museum of History is a member of the International
Council of Museums (ICOM) and a founding  
member of Asian National Museum Association (ANMA). We have mutually
beneficial bilateral and multilateral collaborative relations in the areas of
archaeology, exhibition, maintenance and restoration, research, training,
publishing and conferencing with many museums and research institutions of
China, South Korea, Japan, Laos, The Philippines, France, Belgium, The
Netherlands, UK, US, Russia and Australia.

12/2/2019,The last queen of Vietnam,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/the-last-queen-of-vietnam/,,By Do Nguyet Huong*,,http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1.HH-Nam-Phuong-1.jpg,"_(No.3, Vol.6,Apr-May 2016 Vietnam Heritage Magazine)_

Let your heart be touched by good memories of Queen Nam Phuong, the wife of
Bao Dai, the last king of the Nguyen Dynasty, who abdicated on 23 August,
1945.  
On the morning of 7 August, 1945, while waiting for King Bao Dai to hand over
his royal sword and seal to the Revolutionary government, Queen Nam Phuong
voluntarily had her official headwear with nine golden dragons attached to it
sent through Mr Pham Khac Hoe to the new authorities.  
After that, receiving the news that the French army had returned to restore
their colonial rule in our country, Queen Nam Phuong was crushed with grief.
As an ex-Queen and a woman of independent Vietnam, she sent a message to her
friends worldwide, calling them to fight against the French reoccupation of
Southern Viet Nam. The letter read:  
‘Vietnam has been liberated from Imperial yoke of slavery of France and Japan.
On his abdication, my husband, the former King Bao Dai had announced, “Better
a citizen of an independent country, than a King of an enslaved one.” I have
denounced without regret, all of the Queen’s privileges, in order to help
defend the fatherland’s sacred independence together with other women.  
At this moment, blood is being shed on the Southern land, the cradle of my
childhood. Countless living souls are being burnt by the evil greed of French
colonialists backed by English forces, who act against the instructions of the
allies.  
I call on those who suffered from the cruelties of the recent Great War to act
in order to stop the nameless brutality unleashed on my country.  
In the name of thirteen million women of Vietnam, I humbly ask all my friends
and friends of Vietnam to stand up for our freedom.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/1.HH-Nam-Phuong-1.jpg)_

**Even without her crown, Vietnam’s  
last queen served her people with  
dignity and grace**

By demanding your governments intervene for the establishment of a true and
just peace, you are fulfilling the most urgent responsibilities of humanity
and deserve our people’s utmost gratitude.’  
After the victory of the August Revolution, to help finance the needs of the
revolution and the war of resistance in the South, our government organized
Gold, Silver and Copper Weeks and called on the people to contribute to the
Rice Jar of Unanimity.  
In Hue, the Gold Week was launched on 17 September, 1945 on the South bank of
the Perfume River. Queen Nam Phuong was invited. She was the first person
proposed by pharmacist Pham Doan Diem (Head of Finance Dept. of Thua Thien
Province) to donate gold for the needs of the army. She took of all the
jewellery she wore and put in front of the clerk, who then handed her a
receipt signed by Mr Pham Doan Diem. They also pinned a metal red flag with a
yellow star on her dress. Hue people followed her example and lined up to
contribute until 24 September, 1945. The total contribution was 925 taels of
gold.  
In his memoir ‘The Revival of our Nation’, Mr Truong Chinh also mentioned a
lovely episode about the Queen. ‘…Nam Phuong, Bao Dai’s wife, also made a
beautiful gesture when a counter revolutionary came to advise her to take part
against the Revolutionary Government. She silently walked to the piano in the
corner of her quarters and played the Revolution’s National Anthem.’  
After the National Resistance Day (19 December, 1946), Mrs Nam Phuong and her
children left Hue for France. Although she’s gone, we believe that the
memories about the revolution era never faded in Queen Nam Phuong’s heart.

Vietnam and Franceare two beautiful, well-watered green lands lying at
opposite extremities ofthe vast European Asian landmass connected by history
and, since 1930, by air.Travelling between them these days could not be
simpler. There are frequentdirect flights by Air France from both Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City that do thetrick in only around twelve hours. Curious, I went
along to the Air Franceoffice in the latter city to talk to Country Manager Mr
Guilhem Laurans tolearn more about the history of this air link and also about
its marketingstrategy and how it engages with the public in Vietnam.

The first flight, now eighty-six years ago, was operated byAir Orient. It took
ten days and required seventeen stops for refueling! MrLaurans has a plaque on
his office wall detailing the route. It stopped over incountries that are
today pretty much off limits-Iraq, Iran and Pakistan. Theflight landed at the
airfield in the Phu Tho area of District Eleven, H.C.M. SpaceCity close to
where the Saigon Horse Race Track was to be built two yearslater. Air Orient
was to merge with another airline in 1933 to form Air France,which apart from
a few years due to war, has operated the line continuouslysince that year.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/012.jpg)

Mr. Laurans explained that Air France is the only Europeanairline that has
direct flights to Vietnam and it has a vast network ofconnecting flights
within Europe, as it merged with K.L.M. Dutch airlines anumber of years ago.
Vietnam Airlines also flies direct to Paris and a coupleof other European
capitals. Increasingly, as the country gets wealthier, theVietnamese are
travelling more for leisure. Paris is an attractive destinationfor them.
Whilst European holidaymakers, businessmen and expatriates still makeup the
greater percentage of passengers on the Paris-Vietnam routes, it is nowa two-
way street. ‘Our aim’, Mr Laurans said, ‘Is to be the mostVietnamese-friendly
foreign airline.’ He explained that there is always atleast one Vietnamese-
speaking cabin crew member on every flight and that thereis always a choice of
Vietnamese meals served. In case of visa refusal, ticketfares are reimbursed
one hundred per cent. This applies even to discounted andpromotional fares.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/054616_01.jpg)

Air France has done thorough market research into the needsof its customers.
‘We have listened to our Vietnamese customers’, said M.Laurans. Recently, a
marketing campaign called ‘Air France va Tôi’ (Air Franceand I) was
undertaken. Twelve of the more perspicacious customer comments havebeen
recorded in the 2016 Air France calendar, which I was shown. Mr .Lauranswent
on to say that they have learned that it is not just in the cabin that
theairline needs to excel, but also in services on the ground. There is
oneairline I know which aspires to Air France’s Skytrax four-star status
thatfails abysmally in this area.

Mr Laurans went on to give a general profile of theVietnamese leisure travel.
‘They tend to like to travel in groups’, he said. Hegave the reasons for this.
Firstly, as less-experienced travellers they feelmore confident in a flock.
Then, given the limited holiday time they have(typically only fifteen days per
year) it makes it easier to see more if theitinerary is arranged for them.
Then also for a people that like to carry cash,they feel there are fewer money
worries this way.

Aeroplanes flying long distances necessarily will use up alot of polluting
aviation fuel, but I nevertheless asked about Air France’senvironmental
policy. They are responsible as it is possible to be in thisarea. Firstly, the
KLM part of the company is at the forefront into researchinto the use of
biofuels. Reducing their negative impact on the environment isat the very
heart of the airline’s strategy and in 2015, Air France wasrecognised for this
by being awarded the number one spot in the airlinecategory of the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index for the eleventh consecutiveyear. Air France also invests
in research into how to make aircraft lighter andboth airlines have introduced
a uniform recycling policy. Every employee playsa part in helping this to be a
socially responsible business.

Turning to Air France’s commitment to society at large, theAir France
Foundation supports charities. Notable among these in Vietnam areone that
provides poor deaf people with hearing aids and May Nha (Roof) in MuiNe, which
not only provides a home for orphans but takes care of theireducation, social
development and training until they are of an age to enterthe workplace. The
company sponsors many events too, for example, when Iattended an event a few
years ago at the ‘Vattel Hotel and Restaurant TrainingSchool’, the first prize
for a competition was an Air France return ticket to Paris.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Devant-Air-France-rue-Catinat-
Dong-Khoi-vers-1960.jpg)

I consider myself very lucky to live in the centre of one ofAsia’s great
cities, which once had the sobriquet of ‘Pearl of theOrient’, and where with a
twenty minutedrive to the airport, I can be on a plane that can get me to
Paris in half aday’s time. Not only can I make this journey in comfort, but I
and my familycan be well looked-after on the ground by a company that takes
its role insociety seriously and works for the common good. This company and I
may beEuropean, but like myself who has a Vietnamese family, it takes good
care tointegrate itself into the country it serves.

H? Long Bay has thousands of different-sized islands with folk names, and only
one with a very foreign name: “Titov”.  
This island’s shape is also different from that of most of other H? Long
islands. Looking from above, one will see that only Titov has a beautiful
golden beach, like a crescent moon embroidering part of the island, while the
others’ rock bases, eroded by sea water, look like fruit stalks.  
This island, 8km from shore, used to be called Cát Nàng, a refuge of
fishermen. In 1905, a French ship sank in the sea and the recovered bodies of
its crew were buried here. Since then the island was also called the Cemetery
Island and superstitious fishers stopped harboring here. The island became
desolated.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5616b.jpg)

In January of 1962, Russian cosmonaut Gherman Titov visited Vietnam. Titov was
the second person to ever orbit the Earth, and the first to pilot a spaceship
and photograph and film the Earth from space. Chairman H? Chí Minh took the
Soviet hero around H? Long Bay. Spotting distinctly scenic Cát Nàng, Chairman
H? suggested that they take a rest and have lunch on the island. And then,
Chairman H? proposed to rename the island to Titov. In May of that same year,
the Qu?ng Ninh provincial authorities decided to rename Cát Nàng to Titov.  
After this event, the quiet and pristine Titov beach, washed by daily tides,
began to draw visitors to enjoy the sun, the sea and the sand. In the summer
of 1999, returning to the island bearing his name, Mr. Titov uttered, “How
come so crowded?” He died a year later.  
Recognizing Titov’s natural, historical and touristic potential, in recent
years, Qu?ng Ninh has preserved the scenery on the island and at the same time
built tourist service facilities such as a dock, bars, and a watch tower on
the top peak of the island.  
Today, Titov has become one of the most attractive spots on H? Long Bay, with
popular services such as water scooter rental, pulled parachutes, swimwear and
float rent, fresh water supply and showers. Thousands of people come to Titov
every day.  
In 2013, the authorities decided to build Titov monument on the island. The
stone statue standing on a 106 m2 base cost 7 billion VND.n

Museum of Cham Sculpture, after 1936 (Archive of the École française
d’Extrême-Orient).

Those who come to Danang rarely miss the chance to visit the Cham Sculpture
Museum, or Cham Museum for short. It’s a 100-year-old building with important
architectural, historical and cultural values. Designed by French architects,
it incorporates a few features of Cham temples. Standing on a hill beside the
Han river, it can be seen from miles away as something ancient and poetic. The
museum houses the largest collection of Cham stone sculptures, and ‘the
genuine beauty of these works of art elevate their archeological value, thus
making the museum an enriching promenade for tourists who visit Tourane
(Danang) and the locals alike(1).’  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5524b.jpg)  
Museum of Cham Sculpture, before 1936 (Archive of the École française
d’Extrême-Orient)

The establishment of Cham Museum was due, one could say, to the private
collection of M. Charles Lemire, a French minister to Quang Nam, who was an
art lover and antique collector. He collected these stone sculptures scattered
in the ruins of Cham temples and even in local dwellings and moved them to the
Tourane Park, which was where the Cham museum is now. In the early XX century,
Henri Parmentier was appointed the architect at the École française d’Extrême-
Orient with the mission of studying and preserving Cham architectural remains.
He conducted a thorough inspection of all Cham vestiges to have an overall
picture. From 1902-1903, H.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5524c.jpg)  
Inside the Museum, 2014

Parmentier gave the order to clear and excavate on a large scale the My Son
and Dong Duong temple complexes, and found a great number of valuable
artifacts that could not be held together with the stone sculptures. He then
came up with the idea of building a storage site to keep the Cham relics,
which was the premise of the Cham Museum now.  
However, for many reasons, only a decade later the administration approved the
Tourane Museum proposal and allocated budget for its execution. The
construction began in 1915 and the exhibition was completed in 1919. The
original museum building corresponds to the Tra Kieu room today, and was
called the Musée Cham Tourane.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5524d.jpg)  
A work of Tara on display at Museum of Cham Sculpture

In 1935, the Cham Museum was expanded with two new wings to receive a large
quantity of artifacts found during the excavation at Tra Kieu (Quang Nam) in
1927-1928 and Thap Mam (Binh ?inh) in 1934.The expansion was completed and
grandly opened in Mar 1936 in the presence of the French Plenipotentiary and
King Bao Dai. The Museum was renamed to Musée Henri Parmentier. It held many
valuable works of art representative of the development of Cham sculpture art
during over 10 centuries, from V to XV century.  
During the tumultuous period of 1939 – 1975, the Museum continued its
operations. In 1970, the Museum began to be renovated, expanding exhibition
space and adding surrounding walls. The addition this time was what is now
called the Dong Duong relics exhibition room. At that time, the museum was
called the Danang Museum or Cham Antique Museum.  
After 1975, the Museum was under the heading of the Quang Nam Danang Province
Museum. In 2008, it was separated and has been called Danang Cham Sculpture
Museum since then. During this period, the museum focused on research, study,
archeological excavation and relic collection work, as well as renovation and
conservation of downgraded vestige sites. Many relics were found and added to
the museum’s collection.  
In 2002, Danang city funded the construction of a two-storey building behind
and connected to the old building, with over 4000 m2 space for exhibition,
library, storage, maintenance workshop and offices. In the cooperation and
cultural exchange program with the Republic of France (FSP project) of
2002-2005, the two exhibition rooms of My Son and Dong Duong relics have truly
given a new face to the Museum. This was also a chance for the Museum to
complete the remaining exhibition rooms.  
100 years after the day its construction began, having gone through many
stages of expansion and renovation, Cham Museum managed to preserve its
original architectural features. Ten centuries of Cham sculpture, most notably
the My Son, Tra Kieu, Dong Duong and Thap Mam art, are alive and well
preserved. Through so many historical events and changes, the Museum keeps on
functioning and developing, deepening and modernizing in all aspects,
including human resource development, improving access, maintaining and
renovating exhibited items.  
Most of the items of the My Son collection are dated from VII – VIII
centuries, some from X – XI centuries. My Son shrine (E1[22.4]), VII century,
with 4 sides meticulously carved, is a miniature model of Mount Meru, the
sacred sanctuary of Shiva. It reflects the deep influence of Hinduism on
Champa religious art along the history of this Kingdom.  
The items of the Dong Duong collection have witnessed the advance of Mahayana
Buddhism at the Dong Duong capital of Champa during IX-X centuries. The
Bodhisattva statue [BTDN535], aka Tara, is a masterpiece of ancient art of
bronze casting. Items of the Tra Kieu collection with items dated from XII
century up to X century are very diverse, including shrines, deity statues,
relieves, architectural decorations, animal statues and many others. All exude
soft elegance typical of Tra Kieu style. Tra Kieu shrine [22.2] with linga –
yoni on a square pedestal, four sides of which have a lively, continuous
carving, is also a vivid proof of the prevalence of Hinduism in Champa
Kingdom, as well as of the virtuosity of Cham artisans in combining foreign
influence with local elements to create pieces of sculpture that live
eternally.  
Representing a style which developed at the last stage of Champa art, most of
the Tháp M?m collection is dated XI-XIV centuries and carries features that
show the influence of Khmer art as well as Vi?t art of Lý era. In this
collection the most notable items are perhaps the statues of sacred animals,
such as bird Garuda, leviathan Makara, and the relieves of Shiva.  
In 2012, the three relics My Son El shrine, Tra Kieu shrine and Dong Duong
Bodhisattva Tara were recognized as national treasures. The Ministry of
Culture, Sport and Tourism decided to rank Danang Cham Sculpture Museum a
class I museum, which operates nationwide under the government’s general
program of development of the museum network. The museum is also a focal point
in the planning of Danang city.

Hanoi Museum, a large-scale cultural project of the capital, has completed its
basic construction phase and been in use for five years.  
During that period, Hanoi Museum has fulfilled its mission of introducing to
the public some typical artefacts and collections, fit to be exhibited in the
proposed themes and topics of the future official design of the museum.  
As for the design approach, the museum had the scenario ready almost at the
same time as the construction began; the content is based on six main topics,
namely ‘Geography and natural resources of Hanoi’, ‘The pre-Thang Long
period’, ‘Capital Thang Long in the Dai Viet Civilization’, ‘Hanoi of late
19th, early 20th centuries’, ‘Hanoi, Capital of the Democratic Republic of
Vietnam’, ‘Hanoi, Capital of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam’, and 7 major
themes, namely ‘Uncle Ho and Hanoi’, ‘Hanoi lifestyle’, ‘Ancient money
collections’, ‘Foreign antiques’, ‘Fine handicrafts collections’, ‘Ethnic
cultures’, and ‘Private collections’.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5328c.jpg)

In working sessions with foreign designers, the scenario drafters, science
committee and the museum’s specialists have studied deeper to decide the
content that must be showcased and to propose the types of documents and
artefacts that must be present, many of which must be further collected, since
the museum doesn’t have enough of them.  
It is a big task that requires much effort from the scenario drafters and
Hanoi Museum specialists, especially a lot of know-how and talent from
scientists of many different disciplines, such as museology, archaeology, art,
architecture … The new approach requires innovation and dedication. The
participation of New Zealand specialists in the total design and that of
Japanese specialists in detailed design are crucial. Today, the specific
design of the exhibitions of Hanoi Museum is basically complete and has
achieved significant success.  
![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/5328a.jpg)

Hanoi Museum is currently finishing the outdoor themes, content topics 1 and 2
on the 2nd floor of the building, at the same time finishing the design of the
remaining topics on 3rd and 4th floors. Apart from that, the museum has also
done many topical exhibitions for the public, the most recent being ‘Typical
Antiques of Hanoi Museum’. Soon, to celebrate Cultural Heritage Day (Nov 23rd,
2015), the museum will collaborate with ‘Vietnam Heritage’ magazine to
organize a photo exhibition on the topic of Vietnamese cultural heritage. In
recent years, cultural activities become more and more frequent and higher
quality, thus attracting more attention and appreciation of the community.
This is the right path to the future, when, with the completion of the display
content under the official design, Hanoi Museum will become a cultural
destination, truly dear to the people of the capital, all compatriots and
foreign tourists.n

A normal-looking residence was an arms cache in ‘The American War’

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/4928a.jpg)  
Inside the bunker

Located at 287/70 Nguyen Dinh Chieu St, Dist 3, Ho Chi Minh City, a simple
house has interested many visitors because it features over two tons of
weapons used in the American War.  
In a book at the house, a tourist wrote that ‘Having seen this house and the
bravery of these special people, we can not imagine what they went through. We
should all remember this war and appreciate the hurt that war causes.’ Another
wrote, ‘Thank you so much for letting us view the secret house. That was so
fascinating to see the ingenious methods used to fight the enemy.’ Another
wrote, ‘Very interesting visit, amazing what you can do in a small place.’  
To prepare for ‘The Tet Offensive 1968’, Viet Cong forces transported weapons
and food to bunkers of the households.  
In early 1967, Tran Van Lai, a member of Saigon Special Force, obeyed the
command to buy the house to make room for weapons supporting the attack on the
Independence Palace. The house is 14.9m in length and 2.5m in width with two
secret bunkers. One is underground and is 8m in length, 2m in width and 2.5m
in height. On the wall, there are 4 small round exits leading outside. The lid
of the bunker includes 6 pieces of bricks and has room for just one person
going down.  
Soil produced by digging the bunkers was put in small rubbish bags and dumped
in areas outside Saigon in the evenings. Weapons were hidden in wood coffins,
fruit baskets and bamboo rolls carefully transported to the bunkers from Cu
Chi, 60 km away from Saigon. Mr Van Lai worked on the bunkers that were so
secret that his neighbours did not suspect their existence.  
Until 1968, the bunkers concealed two tons of ammunition. ‘The Tet Offensive
1968’ was approaching.  
However the mission was uncompleted. Most of 17 soldiers attacking the
Independence Palace on the night of the first day of the first month were
killed. Tran Van Lai and the remainder were arrested. The enemy found the
house and shot at it to find Viet Cong. However, they never knew about the
bunkers.  
In 1988, it was recognized as Historical Cultural Vestiges of National Level
by the Ministry of Culture.  
Many mementos of the soldiers are on display in the house. Many holes caused
by guns by American soldiers and the Republic of Vietnam are still in the
door.n

According to declassified CIA Documents on the Vietnam War, featured on
[www.americal4ofthe3.com](http://www.americal4ofthe3.com/), ‘The Tet Offensive
was a military campaign conducted between 30 January and 23 September 1968, by
forces of the Viet Cong, or National Front for the Liberation of South
Vietnam, and the North Vietnamese army, or People’s Army of Vietnam, against
the forces of the Republic of Vietnam, (South Vietnam), the United States and
their allies during the Vietnam War. The purpose of the offensive was to
strike military and civilian command and control centres throughout South
Vietnam and to spark a general uprising among the population that would then
topple the Saigon, government, thus ending the war in a single blow. The Viet
Cong launched a major offensive beginning with a wave of attacks began on the
morning of 30 January. This early attack did not, however, cause undue alarm
or lead to widespread allied defensive measures. When the main communist
operation began the next morning, the offensive was countrywide in scope and
well coordinated, with more than 80,000 Viet Cong troops striking more than
100 towns and cities, including 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five of the six
autonomous cities, 72 of 245 district towns, and the national capital. The
offensive was the largest military operation yet conducted by either side up
to that point in the war. The initial Viet Cong attacks stunned allied forces
and took them by surprise, but most were quickly contained and beaten back,
inflicting massive casualties on the communists. Although the offensive was a
military disaster for Viet Cong forces, it had a profound effect on the
American administration and shocked the American public, which had been led to
believe by its political and military leaders that the communists were, due to
previous defeats, incapable of launching such a massive effort. Except at Hue
and mopping-up operations in and around Saigon, the first surge of the
offensive was over by the second week of February. The U.S. estimated that
during the first phase (30 January – 8 April, 1968) approximately 45,000
communist soldiers were killed and an unknown number were wounded.’

Fito Museum displays over 3,000 objects, from the Stone Age to the 20th
century, involved in Vietnamese traditional medicine. The museum was founded
in 2007 by the Fito Pharma Company.  
The museum is not an immense and majestic palace with iron fences and
security. It features a five-storey house with two bamboo trees in front of
its façade.  
Inside the museum, I felt intimate with the simple and natural Vietnamese
architecture. At the ticket box, I was impressed by a lift overlaid with wood.
Also, I was very interested to see drawings excerpted from old medical books
and yellow-paper medicine ads from the 1900’s hanging on the walls at the
wooden stairs.  
The museum is decorated with animal and pattern carvings on wood pillars,
rafters, roofs, doors, shelves and sets of tables. Hanging on the walls are
carved wood and colour paintings depicting the acts of examining, preparing
medicine, prescribing, preparing the herbs and gilded wood paintings featuring
famous physicians who devoted themselves to developing of Vietnamese
traditional medicine.  
Vietnamese discovered plants for treatment diseases in the Hung Vuong Dynasty
(2879-258 BC). Vietnamese knew how to use ginger, garlic and other herbs for
disease prevention and treatment. They chewed betel with lime and areca to
keep the body warm and protect from tooth decay. During the Tran Dynasty
(1226-1399), the government organized trips to collect medicinal plants. Also,
they planted herbs in Duoc Son (Medicine Mountain), Hai Duong Province, to
make medicine. Duoc Son was the first national medicine garden in Vietnam.  
From the 4th to 10th centuries, Chinese medicine deeply affected Vietnamese
medicine. At first, two branches conflicted with each other. Between the 10th
century and the 20th century, they combined together to form Vietnamese
Traditional Medicine. At that stage, Western medicine also appeared.

A drawing showing vital points in the arm

One room showed two statues of the greatest physicians Tue Tinh (14th Century)
and Hai Thuong Lan Ong Le Huu Trac (18th Century) who were well-known as the
founders of Vietnamese Traditional Medicine. As in the past, those who reached
the pinnacle of any career would be honoured as a god or saint and so it was
with these two. Tue Tinh was a monk and the author of many medical books. At
22, he passed an examination, but he refused to work as a mandarin and went
into a pagoda to become a monk and treat people. He began the idea of taking
Vietnamese herbs through the statement, ‘Vietnamese herbs for Vietnamese’.  
Hai Thuong Lan Ong (1720 – 1791) was the author of ‘Hai Thuong Y Tong Tam
Linh’ (Medical origins with morality and skills of Hai Thuong), considered as
an encyclopaedia of Vietnamese traditional medicine. On the occasion of 250th
anniversary of his birthday, UNESCO recognized him as a world cultural
celebrity due to his contribution to traditional medicine and culture of
Vietnam and the world. In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, streets specialise in
selling traditional medicine are named Hai Thuong Lan Ong or Lan Ong.  
One room was an old house from the 19th Century, which was moved from Hanoi.
The house was in a northern style, made of wood, tilted roof and with a small,
lush garden. Pointing to a bat swinging on the roof the guide told me: ‘Bat
faeces can increase sexuality ability in men.’  
One room displayed a model of a small wooden traditional pharmacy in the 19th
Century, including a cabinet with 81 drawers containing herbs and a counter
for preparing herbs with a weight, mortar and pestle, papers and abacus.  
Another room showed many things with a variety of shapes, sizes and made of
stone, wood, ceramic, terracotta and metals. They were mortars, pestles, lime
holders, lime pots, balances for weighing herbs, bowls for taking medicine,
wine jars containing tonic wines, coins for ‘rubbing the wind’, boat-shaped
drug grinders and medical herb slicer.  
At the top floor, one room displayed Cham statues, linga and yoni. The guide
told me if one is looking for a girlfriend or boyfriend, they should just
touch the statue of linga or yoni, and woman who wants to get pregnant should
just pour water on the top of linga, wait for it to flow down the yoni to the
base and then drink it.n

The Memorial of the Heroic Vietnamese Mother in Quang Nam Province

Cam Hill of Tam Phu Commune, Tam Ky town, Quang Nam Province, has a Memorial
of the Heroic Vietnamese Mother, the biggest of the country, a token of
gratitude to the infinite sacrifices of Vietnamese mothers during the wars for
independence and unification of the Father Land.  
Finished on 24 March, 2015 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of liberation of
Quang Nam Province, the Memorial was classified by the Prime Minister as a
national cultural monument.  
The Memorial was built in the image of Vietnam heroic mother Nguyen Thi Thu of
Dien Thang Commune, Dien Ban District, Quang Nam Province. She lost nine sons,
one son-in-law and one grandson in the wars against the French and the
Americans.  
The construction began in July 2009 with a VND411 billions investment,
following a deeply nationalistic design sketched by artist Dinh Gia Thang. It
took the architects, engineers, artists and workers six years to finish it.  
The 18.5m tall bow-shaped granite statue is 101m long and symbolizes a
mother’s protective embrace. At the front, 30 stone candles represent the 30
years she waited for the day of liberation, when her children would come back
to her. Leading to the monument are eight sandstone pillars with reliefs
depicting heroic Vietnamese mothers from all over the country.  
There is also a pond and a stone garden with carved poems. Behind the monument
is one half of a museum housing steles that show pictures and tell life
stories of nearly 50,000 Vietnam heroic mothers and their contributions to the
country. Inside the granite monument is the other half that has a reception
and exhibition room, plus an archive area. On the two sides of the monument
are two flower carpets with decorations characteristic of the 54 ethnicities
of the country.n

More than forty years later, I can still hear Senator McGovern’s words sailing
into the frigid Washington afternoon from a podium none of us could see, as
there were so many of us.  
‘We are all prisoners of war,’ he said.

![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/Robert-Hirschfield.jpg)  
Robert Hirschfield

Philosophically among the truest words ever spoken by an American politician.
The Vietnam War did imprison America. It built around itself a wall to keep
sanity out. It incarcerated history in an airless room called the Domino
Theory, for which three million Vietnamese and fifty-eight thousand Americans
lost their lives. But the war did free those of us who opposed it from the
prison of imagining war as an abstraction.  
The faces of fleeing Vietnamese, of fearful Vietnamese, of dead and wounded
Vietnamese, were our dinner companions (intruders, some might say) during the
nightly news. We digested their images of suffering as we digested our food.
For many years we ate the war in Vietnam without our being able to spit it
out.  
Every night, we would hear of the day’s ‘body count.’ As if the war was a
factory and bodies were its inventory. I could not stop thinking about those
‘bodies.’ Who did they belong to? What kinds of lives were lived in those
bodies? Lives that dreamt, grew bored, grew angry, told jokes, wrote poetry,
had wives, had calluses?  
A dangerous line of thinking. I knew others infected by it. It lead us into
dark, disaffected, disruptive corners of ourselves, which in turn lead us (at
least those of us who lived in Manhattan at the time) to Times Square one
night, near the army recruitment office. We began by shouting the usual
slogans that no one ever paid any attention to. Then we did something everyone
paid attention to, especially ourselves, as such a thing had never been done
before. We took out a Viet Cong flag and unfurled it under the shining lights
of Broadway. We had crossed a forbidden border, and we all knew it. People
rushed us from all sides grabbing at the flag, cursing us for waving it, for
waving the flag of the enemy.  
To feel like a stranger in your own country, hang out beneath the wrong flag
in a time of war. Even an undeclared war. We walked around like characters in
a Dostoyevsky novel, patrolling our unhappy underground, railing against a
national mindset that could co-exist with napalm, Agent Orange, tiger cages,
carpet bombings.  
Unlike other Americans who opposed the war, and there of course were many who
did, for us an essential connection had been broken between ourselves and the
makers of American policy, between ourselves and the cold warriors in the
media, like the Alsops, who wrote in support of that policy whose results
could be seen every night on TV in the terrified eyes of villagers. The truth
of the Vietnam War, unlike the wars we fought ever since, entered our living
rooms and kitchens thanks to the reporters and their cameras. The intimacy of
devastation.  
The networks may have been on America’s side, but the cameras supported the
Vietnamese. To see is to know. And to know is a burden. Some burdens can’t be
put down. Some burdens break one down.  
The Weathermen blew up buildings, robbed banks, killed policemen. Charlotte,
my girl friend at the time (we were all in our twenties and thirties)
committed suicide to protest the war. She was naturally disorganized, and the
suicide note she sent to the Fifth Avenue Peace Parade Committee, was sent to
the wrong address. No one who knew her was surprised.  
I got into blood arguments with relatives. (Well, one or two maybe. An uncle
here, a cousin there. My cousins, for the most part, lined up on the left. Our
parents all went through the Great Depression. The America of the sixties and
seventies was not the America of today.) I insisted on knowing how people
could go through their lives as if nothing were happening. Had they no shame,
no feeling? I was a prisoner of anger.  
Even now, I still identify parts of this city with that time. When I am on the
Upper West Side, around 94th or 95th Street, I think of Charlotte’s room in
the run down Narragansett Hotel, where my girl friend would take out maps of
Vietnam to show me where exactly a factory had been bombed, a school levelled.
Her room was piled high with books about Vietnam, with articles from every
major and minor magazine and newspaper dealing with Vietnam. She knew the
names of low-level Viet Cong leaders. She spoke of the ‘DRV’ the way one
speaks of family.  
Being with her was like being in a Vietnamese room, with all its tears and
mournful cries. I had never before known a person to grieve for a country.
With Charlotte, you always knew that you were loved second best. She was not
the girl friend you dream of, but it was she who introduced me to ‘Uncle Ho’s’
poetry, who told me how he’d mimic the gestures of Chou En Li behind his back.
She was a one woman Vietnam search engine before the Internet.  
Near my house on the Lower East Side is where the Catholic Workers set up to
serve the poor. The radical priests, Dan and Phil Berrigan, came there to
denounce the war. Daniel Ellsberg, author of the Pentagon Papers, spoke there
with bitter regret of his one- time support for the war. Maybe one day someone
will write a novel about Moratorium Day in Manhattan when secretaries went to
work wearing black armbands to protest a war that had gone on far too long and
with no good reason.  
I sometimes wonder what became of those women. I sometimes wonder what became
of my city, where people can now sleep so easily through our latest series of
foreign wars. The war in Vietnam shook some of us awake. Some of us have never
gone back to sleep.n

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/DNK_9961.jpg)_  
A statue of the guard outside.

Just 20 km South of Hanoi, Van Tao Commune is a peaceful land, with many pure
Vietnamese cultural features. People here are mostly farmers, attached to
their paddy fields. Recently, I learned the bonsai has become their new source
of income.  
The rollercoaster development in the city seems not to affect life here.
Around the new industrial zones, there are bazaars where one can buy plants,
chickens and pigs. In the villages, people still use well water. Laterite
walls and tile roofs slowly weather, waiting for time to cover them with a
coat of moss.  
Perhaps that’s why the soft solemnity pertaining to northern culture still
glows around the temples and pagodas in this area. Who would fancy that a
grand relic lay just a few yards beneath this unassuming ground?  
Tradition says that Admiral Duke Do Ba Pham of Dai Giang was a useful figure
under Lord Trinh Cuong. When Prince Trinh Giang succeeded to the throne, Pham
fell out of grace. He started preparing for a world without him. He ordered
stones from Dong Trieu, Quang Ninh Province to be placed on waterways to Van
Tao, where he saw a good land formation. He hired master stone masons to carve
the stones and build his tomb on joints, without bonding materials.  
The whole area is divided into three parts; the gate, the pre-death tomb, and
the grave. Architecturally, the tomb is the most notable part. On both sides
of the path leading into the tomb, there is an incense table made of
monolithic stones, intricately carved. On the tablets is written ‘Dragon and
horse play ball’ and ‘Lions kow-tow’, together with reliefs of lotuses, clouds
and fire and even an ink-slab and brushes.  
Another notable detail is the stone throne, similar to those in the hind part
of the village communal houses next to the Land Lord’s votive tablet.
Remarkably, the stone carvings on this throne are no less delicate and
meticulous than the wooden ones.  
The last part is an obelisk that houses the gravestone, and the grave of the
Admiral Duke Do Ba Pham of Dai Giang. The obelisk design is quite unique,
because the stone roof and the four supporting pillars are connected only by
joints, but the structure is very solid. The gravestone tells of the three
generations of merits of the Duke, but carries no date of death.  
The grave house right behind the obelisk has the typical turtle shell shape,
with a spiky top and four roofs. There is a rumor that there used to be
buildings around the grave house and the grave has a mechanical trap that
makes it collapse if intruded upon.  
One can talk for days about the architecture of Admiral Do Ba Pham’s tomb,
because it is a landmark masterpiece which remains almost intact. But the most
impressive are the statues, especially the totem statues, which are purely
Vietnamese. The pure essence of the Vietnamese shows in the peacefulness,
gentleness and realness of the statues and the animals.  
Outside the gate, a pair of stone dogs in tintinnabula used to stand guard.
One of them is missing, and the other is seriously damaged. But dogs are the
house keepers and the remaining dog’s bearing shows it. Right behind the dogs
stand two sturdy and serious-looking guards. The guard statues are made very
realistically, from body size to facial features.  
The most impressive is the pair of real-size, authentically detailed stone
elephants. They must have been made by master carvers with great knowledge.
They are twins, with deep-set, expressive eyes. Elephants are usually
encountered at temples and pagodas, but this pair is one of a kind because
they are too beautiful, too real.  
Behind the crouching elephants is a pair of full-size horses. They are real in
every detail, without any flourishes or stylization. We can even learn from
them how people used to harness horses at the time.

Then, another pair of stone dogs. These don’t sit like the guard dogs at the
gate, but crouch in front of the second incense table before an obelisk. The
special thing about these dogs is that they were made without any
sophisticated detail. They seem to be a couple, male and female, and there is
a puppy sitting next to the female. It’s a happy dog family. And of course,
these dogs are cute and tranquil, not fierce at all.  
The only unreal things present in the tomb area are the lions. Interestingly,
although made 300 years ago, this stone lion pair is still very new. They show
power and authority, but at the same time seem to be friendly and easy to
approach.  
Ms Pham Thi Cuong, whose family has lived at the tomb gate for 4 generations,
said that the whole village knew nothing about the tomb because it was buried
too long ago. Previous generations had to worry about famine and social
turmoil. The great flood of 1914 broke the dykes and smashed away everything
on its way. Only the strongest buildings on the highest spots survived. People
had to evacuate en masse. When the flood water receded, everything, including
Duke Van’s tomb, was buried under the alluvial soil.  
As a witness of the excavation of the tomb, Ms Cuong said that it was done in
1984 or 1986. Miraculously, the tomb was almost intact.  
Ms Cuong has seen all of the places in her district, and she is sure that such
beautiful totem statues can be found nowhere else. A few years after the
excavation, life was too hard, so only very few people came to see the tomb.
Later, when things got better, many came to contemplate the wonders, and she
began to help the curator to take care of the tomb.

at Ba Vanh Tomb,  
Huong Thuy Town,  
Thua Thien Hue Province.  
_Photo provided by Nguyen Dac Xuan_

**A 77-year old researcher is a self-made expert on the kings of Hue  
**

In recent decades, Hue has attracted the attention of many domestic and
foreign culturologists. Mr Nguyen Dac Xuan is perhaps one of the most special
among them. He has dedicated almost all his life to study Hue’s culture, and
people call him a ‘Hue-ologist’.  
Nguyen Dac Xuan was born in 1937, in a family that had three generations
working in royal palaces. ‘This helped a lot in my research work, because I
can compare the materials with what my father and grandfather told me,’ he
said.  
Mr Xuan receives me in a room filled with thousands of books, neatly arranged
on shelves. To him, the nearly 700-year history of Hue includes many domains,
including topography, philosophy, Buddhism, music and literature.  
To collect materials in these areas, Mr Xuan constantly left his beloved Hue.
He has books in Chinese, French, English and  
Vietnamese and hundreds photographs. ‘I have books that nobody else in Vietnam
does. And I have invaluable photos, too,’ he affirmed.  
The agile old man also made hundreds of cassette and video tapes of the Kings’
wives, children, grand children, and the former servants of the royal family.
‘King Bao Dai’s second wife, Mrs Mong Diep, brought me 52 cassette tapes. I am
among the very few Vietnamese who have met Princess Nhu Ly, King Ham Nghi’s
daughter, who lives in seclusion in France,’ Mr Xuan said.  
His research has brought him materials from the pagodas, churches, and
genealogical records of Hue families. He carefully reads and compares it all,
including the artefacts, before writing books about Hue.  
To date, the old man has written over 50 books about Hue culture, including
one about Ho Chi Minh’s childhood in Hue, the search for Emperor Quang Trung’s
tomb a clarification on the exile of Kings Ham Nghi, Thanh Thai, Duy Tan, Bao
Dai; and books unveiling some of Hue’s secrets.  
‘After 40 years studying Hue’s history, I have concluded that Hue culture is
Great Viet culture, influenced by ancient Champa culture. So it has both the
Northern vitality and the Southern deep torment. This is a general theorem,
applicable to all aspects of this culture,’ he asserted.  
I asked which aspect was the focus of his research. ‘History is made by man,
so I paid most of my attention to the people, focusing on the upper ruling
class. I am especially fascinated by the Tay Son Dynasty’s emperor Quang Trung
and the 13 Kings of Nguyen Dynasty, because their fates reflect that of the
nation. For example, the life of the four exiled kings shows that the nation’s
fate was in the hands of the French,’ Mr Xuan said.  
‘What about the kings interests you?’ I asked.

**Mr Xuan advises those who want to feel Hue culture to visit the royal
palaces and all the seven royal tombs, or at least the four tombs of Gia Long,
Minh Mang, Tu Duc, Khai Dinh; then go to see Tu Dam, Linh Mu Pagodas and Tu
Hieu and Hoang Mai Monasteries. At night, they should take a boat cruise on
Perfume River and listen to Hue calling songs, then go to see An Huyen garden
(an estate of a court official), Phu Mong old house, and Phuoc Tich old
village, then visit trade villages to see how things used to be made; palm
leaf hats at Phu Cam, bronze at Phuong Duc, embroideries at Phung Loc, then
see court opera in the old citadel and during all this time, enjoy the
uniquely Hue treats, especially the nam, loc and beo pastries.  
**

‘Everything, from running the country, their everyday life, their eating and
drinking habits, to the little known secrets, such as the intrigues in the
power struggle, the kings’ sex life, incest in the royal family and outbursts
of jealousy among the kings’ concubines.’ he replied.  
To study the character and fate of the kings, he had to scour through the
written materials, royal palaces, tombs, indulgence dens, incognito routines,
and exile sites of all the Nguyen Kings.  
Mr Xuan summed up that each king’s life is reflected best in his tomb. He
argued, ‘Heroic Gia Long Tomb belongs to an intrepid king. Mighty Minh Mang
tomb belongs to a king who ruled by strict and consistent law. Pensive Tu Duc
tomb shows his poetic nature. Grandiose Khai Dinh tomb demonstrates his love
for luxury.’  
Some of Nguyen Dac Xuan’s research works were met with scepticism. ‘A few
years ago I published my findings about the tomb of the world renowned emperor
Quang Trung, and was criticized fiercely. But I fired back openly and
convincingly. I challenge any dispute,’ he said.

The scene before destruction

**Unique danger tourism  
brings awareness of  
unexploded ordinance**

In Quang Tri, the most ‘mine-polluted’ land of the country, there is a tour
for visitors to get close to these deadly weapons.  
Not everybody knows about this new and exotic kind of tourism. Many local
people, known among jokers by the dashing title ‘Bomb Sawyers,’ shook their
heads when asked about it.  
The Renew Quang Tri organization, with the aid of Norwegian People’s Aid and
Vietnam Backpackers Hostels, created this unique tour. It’s been functioning
for over two years, having taken 76 groups, mostly foreign, to the detonation
sites.  
According to Renew, Quang Tri is the most heavily mine-polluted in the
country, with 3,866 km² of mined land (83 per cent of the total area, while
the country’s average is only 21 per cent). From 1975 to 2010, there were
7,035 victims of the leftover mines and bombs in Quang Tri, 31 per cent of who
were children.  
When I registered with Mr Nguyen Thanh Phu, a staff member of Renew Quang Tri,
in addition to my name, place of work and ID number, I had to check a blood
type box on the form. ‘This tour involves mines and bombs, so one cannot be
too careful. At the site, there are even more strict rules to guarantee
absolute safety for visitors,’ he explained.  
Early that afternoon, a van picked him and I up at the Quang Tri province’s
Exhibition Centre of Overcoming the Consequences of War to the detonation site
at Vinh An Village, Cam Hieu Commune, Cam LoDistrict. In the van there were 15
young tourists from the UK, US, Norway, and Holland.  
Thomas Stone, head of Renew and one of the main founders of this fascinating
tour, said, ‘like the previous 75 groups, this group’s members are young (aged
18-20), mainly students on summer vacation. They may at best know just a
little about the Vietnam War through literature, and a little about bombs and
mines through the TV, I guess.’  
Thomas Stone has lived in Vietnam for over five years and had worked sometime
at Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park, Quang Binh Province. He has made a lot
of efforts to promote the ‘mine tours’ in Quang Tri in the process of taking
his ‘guests’ to discovering Vietnam, because ‘Just like me before, these young
people only know vaguely about war, and they want to know more. I take them
here to see, that after over 40 years, the weapons of war are still there,
fully functional, in Quang Tri villages, in people’s living quarters. This is
the fastest and simplest way for them to understand, to a certain extent, war
and the pain of its aftermath.’  
The van stopped at the end of a red soil path, surrounded by a desert, not too
far from residential area. Mr Le Xuan Tung, head of Explosive Ordnance
Disposal and his team were waiting for us. After explaining basic steps of his
team’s work, he told us that morning, his team found three HE mortars, and two
40 mm shells in this area, all American made. ‘We will destroy these right
here. We have prepared the ditches, sand bags, explosives and wires over
there. You have 10 minutes to come to see the scene under our supervision
before retreating to safety and watch the destruction,’ he said.

_![](http://www.vietnamheritage.com.vn/Uploads/11vdnwe782.jpg)_  
The ordinance is exploded

We gathered at about 300 metres from the explosion field to watch the most
thrilling part. Liam O’Connell, a 21-year old Englishman, was lucky to be
assigned to push the detonation button. Eyes and cameras were all ready. We
heard a ‘boom’ and we saw a big, dense cloud of smoke and dirt. ‘It’s a hard
to describe the sensation. I am still quite shocked.’ Liam confessed.  
Then the visitors can collect some shrapnel as a unique ‘trophy’ to show off
to those back home.  
Thomas Stone told me that a part of the revenue of the tour is used to help
the victims in Quang Tri. ‘I always hint and encourage the visitors to donate
for the victims of mines and Agent Orange. The amount may be small, but money
for this purpose can never be useless or wasted,’ he said. He also told me
that he currently organizes two ‘mine tours’ a week, and the number of
tourists who want to join the tour is increasing significantly. He hopes the
amount of donation will also increase accordingly.  
To Phu, who accompanied almost all the 76 touring groups, the most rewarding
thing is the transition of visitors’ emotions before and after seeing the
mines and their destructive power. ‘Normally it takes some time to ponder
after you see it. But it’s not easy for the descendants of American and South
Vietnamese ex-military men. We show them the horrors of war, not to invoke the
feeling of guilt, but to make them feel eager to heal, to promote peace and to
share something with the victims,’ Phu said.  
Stories told by Mr Ngo Xuan Hieu, manager of communication and development of
Renew Quang Tri, were even more heart-softening. An Irish doctor, Mr Aidan
Ryan, moved by the ‘mine tour’, after coming home, has organized a bicycle
event in Dublin in August, 2014, to raise money for Quang Tri mine victims. Or
an overseas Vietnamese actor, Mr Trieu Tran, after visiting a family of Agent
