enhances the flavor or any dish, as readily as the right dash of this, the
right teaspoon of that. No wonder executive chefs the world over have a lot to
say about the playlists on their dining room speakers.

In Vietnam these days, they’re doubling down on the enhancement factor by
having kitchen staff repurpose ladles as microphones. Waiters and cooks at the
[Alma resort](https://www.alma-resort.com/) on the [Cam
Ranh](https://www.alma-resort.com/destination) peninsula are now belting out
medleys of classic hits at [La Casa ](https://www.alma-
resort.com/restaurants/la-casa)[restaurant](https://www.alma-
resort.com/restaurants/la-casa) every Wednesday and Friday evening.

With ladles, pans and tambourines in hand, and with a live piano as a
foundation, the apron-and-toque donning Alma Choir break into song and dance
as suddenly as a flash mob to perform international and Vietnamese tunes.
Their repertoire includes Abba’s _Mamma Mia_ , Boney M’s _Rivers of Babylon_ ,
Nguyễn Hồng Thuận’s _Xinh Tươi Viet Nam_ ( _Beautiful Vietnam_ ) and Đức Huy’s
_Lời Yêu Thương_ ( _Words of Love_ ).

What began as a group of staff banding together to sing Christmas carols in
the weeks leading up to Alma’s debut in late December last year has matured
into a professional outfit under the stewardship of the resort’s resident
pianist Ben Guillen and guest experience manager Maya Nguyen.

“Christmas is the one time of the year I really miss my country Austria and
its Christmas markets so I wanted to bring that festive spirit to Alma and
asked who wanted to be part of a Christmas choir,” said Laubichler-Pichler, a
hospitality veteran who has managed some of Vietnam’s most acclaimed hotels.
“Sixteen staff from our resort’s various departments, including front office,
food and beverage, recreation, and spa, answered the call and oh how they can
sing; they have become a permanent fixture at our resort, bringing tears of
joy to the eyes of our diners.”

Guillen, who has a background in musical arrangement, said the response from
the diners at La Casa, a sophisticated and capacious dining setting seating up
to 164 guests had been so positive “some customers have danced on their
seats”.

He also said that, in light of the recent flare-up in COVID-19 cases in
Danang, all of the singers would be social distancing from each other and
guests during performances.

In addition to performing at La Casa twice a week, Alma Choir practices at
[Alma Lounge](https://www.alma-resort.com/bars-and-lounges/alma-lounge) three
times a week as Guillen plays the lounge’s grand piano. The choir is also
available to perform at special [events](https://www.alma-resort.com/meetings-
and-events) at the resort including weddings.

_“The Singing Waiters and Cooks” is staged each Wednesday and Friday evening
at La Casa from 7pm. Complimentary for diners, the choir performs two songs
from their_ _extensive repertoire before the resort’s resident singer Engie
sings two song solo followed by the choir performing another two songs._
