The country’s leading real estate awards programme was held Friday, 9 October
2020, at the InterContinental Saigon in Ho Chi Minh City, where outstanding
builders from northern to southern Vietnam converged to vie for 49 awards.

Presented by Kohler, the 6th PropertyGuru Vietnam Property Awards turned out
to be a festive occasion for celebrating the nation’s rising crop of
integrated township developments, master planned communities, mixed-use sites,
and new urban areas.

Winning eight of its 12 nominations, Gamuda Land Vietnam was hailed Vietnam’s
Best Developer of 2020. One of its stand-out projects, Celadon City, a massive
development by Gamuda Land (HCMC) Joint Stock Company in HCMC, won Best
Masterplan Design.

SonKim Land Corporation also accumulated eight wins, including the honour for
Best Boutique Developer. The most awarded project of the night was The Crest
Residence, the ultra-luxury condo development also known as the second phase
of SonKim Land’s mixed-use site Metropole Thu Thiem. The Crest Residence was
adjudged Best Condo Development (Vietnam) while another project in the
vicinity, Metropole Thu Thiem Office Complex 1, garnered the trophy for Best
Office Development.

Stella Mega City – a project by the winner of the Best Breakthrough Developer
award, Kita Group Corporation Joint Stock Company – was named Best Township
Development. Ecopark Tourism and Trade Urban Area gained the title of Best
Mega Township Development – one of five wins by Ecopark Corporation Joint
Stock Company, which won Best Mixed Use Developer.

Masterise Homes, a member of Masterise Group, is another big winner of the
night, with six trophies backed by its Lumière Riverside, Masteri Centre
Point, and Masteri Waterfront projects.

As a capstone to an already triumphant night, the award for Vietnam Real
Estate Personality of the Year was presented to Vingroup Chairman Pham Nhat
Vuong, better known to many as the nation’s first and biggest billionaire.

After finding success with an instant-noodle business in Europe, Vuong
established one of Vietnam’s biggest property development companies and turned
it into the country’s largest private conglomerate, Vingroup. A true builder
of skylines, Vuong led Vingroup to develop Landmark 81, the country’s tallest
building. Le Khac Hiep, Vice Chairman of Vingroup, accepted the award at the
gala dinner.

The Vietnam Real Estate Personality of the Year award was the only accolade
not chosen by the independent panel of judges, but by the editorial team of
PropertyGuru Property Report, the official magazine of the Asia Property
Awards

Hari V. Krishnan, CEO of PropertyGuru Group, said: “Congratulations to the
winning companies and projects at the 6th PropertyGuru Vietnam Property
Awards. We are proud to be the preferred platform for recognizing and honoring
the best creators of what’s next in Vietnam, from mega townships and master-
planned communities to new urban areas that will transform the built
environment in this stellar property market for years to come.”

Jules Kay, Managing Director of PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards & Events,
said: “The PropertyGuru Vietnam Property Awards provide a standard by which
the country’s developers strive to be measured. By showcasing the outstanding
companies behind Vietnam’s skylines and living spaces we also shine light on
the continued modernisation and growth throughout the country. From mega
townships to the developer of the country’s tallest building, this year’s
winning projects and companies make it clear that Vietnam remains one of the
most impressive property markets in Asia.”

This marked another year of strong representation for industrial development
in Vietnam. The title of Best Industrial Development was presented to Rang
Dong Textile Industrial Park (Aurora IP) by Cat Tuong Real Estate Group Joint
Stock Company. Viet Nam Singapore Industrial Park & Township Development Joint
Stock Company (VSIP JSC) meanwhile won six out of its eight nominations,
including Best Residential Green Development for The Habitat Binh Duong, its
venture with Sembcorp Gateway Development Co., Ltd.
